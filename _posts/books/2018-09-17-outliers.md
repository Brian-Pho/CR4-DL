## General Notes

- Date of birth and cutoff dates affect a person’s success rate. People with more time get the “accumulative advantage”. Cutoff dates matter.
- Hard work triumphs over talent. 10,000 hours for mastery. Not everyone is born equal. Not just based on individual merit. Fate verses choice.
- IQ threshold. IQ doesn’t equal smartness. IQ as a logarithmic graph. Divergence and convergence test. ABCD verses brick and blanket. IQ doesn’t equal creativity.
- Be assertive, culture affects us. Cultural legacies matter.
- Asian people are good at math because the language component makes it easy and the culture is hard working.

## Evolution Notes

- Organisms don’t adapt to the environment. They change randomly and by chance they get better traits suited to the environment.
- Survival of the fittest doesn’t mean the strongest organism, it means the organism best suited to it’s environment, not survival, not reproduction.
- Evolution has no purpose.
