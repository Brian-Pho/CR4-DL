## Introduction

- What made us human was our control of fire and the advent of cooked meals.
- Cooking increases the value of our food by
  - Making food safer
  - Making it tastier
  - Reducing spoilage
  - Breaking down tough foods
- Some think that the greatest change in evolution was the eating of meat.
- Habilines, the missing link between apes and humans, shows that there were two changes in the path from ape to human
  - One 2.5 million years ago.
  - One between 1.9 and 1.8 million years ago.
- Meat eating accounts for the first transition.
- The author believes cooking accounts for the second transition.
- But the main advantage of cooking is that it increases the amount of energy our bodies obtain from our food.
- The extra energy allows us to have more free time and to grow bigger brains.
- Humans are cooking apes; creatures of the flame.

## Chapter 1: Quest for Raw-Foodists

- Are humans dependent on cooked foods or is it a random preference that we evolved?
- An experiment was run where people ate from 70% to 100% raw food and the conclusion was that a strict raw food diet cannot guarantee an adequate energy supply.
- The subjects of the experiment started losing weight even though they were healthy.
- Maybe the difference was that they ate less meat?
- Among people who eat cooked diets, there's no difference in body weight between vegetarians and meat eaters.
- Any system that reduces the size of food particles, such as grinding and crushing, leads to predictable increases in energy gain.
- Everywhere we look, home cooking is the norm in all human cultures.
- There's abundant evidence and stories of people surviving on raw food but only temporarily or eating high quality raw foods that are highly processed.
- There's no long term evidence, such as longer than a year, that a person can survive on wild, raw food.
- We are not like other animals in that we need cooked food to survive.

## Chapter 2: The Cook’s Body

- At some point in evolution, our ancestors must have been able to use raw foods effectively because our primate cousins do. So what changed?
- Evolutionary trade-offs are common are in nature.
- E.g. Long legs make it harder to climb but easier to walk. Long arms make it easier to climb but harder to walk.
- Similarly, our poor effectiveness at digesting raw food lets us process cooked foods much better.
- E.g. We have smaller digestive systems compared to our cousin apes which allows them to process raw foods better at the cost of more energy.
- Cooked food offers two advantages
  - Spontaneous advantages that almost any species, when fed cooked food, can use by growing faster and more efficiently.
  - Evolutionary benefits such as the smaller mouths, weaker jaws, smaller guts, etc. that use less energy when compared to apes.
- It also seems like our digestive systems evolved around cooked food but is this the case?
- Maybe our digestive system evolved to handle meat and handling cooked food was a byproduct.
- Evidence suggests that we didn’t evolved to eat raw meat as our teeth aren't as sharp, compared to lions and dogs, and food passes our stomach too quickly.
- Since cooking predictly destroys many toxins, we may have evolved a relatively sensitive palate.
- We are cooks more than carnivores.

## Chapter 3: The Energy Theory of Cooking

- Cooking increases the amount of energy we get from food by
  - Gelantinizing starch
  - Denaturing proteins
  - Softening everything
- Softer foods provide more energy because they are cheaper to digest.
- The effects of grinding and cooking are independent as both methods can be used together to get even more energy out of food.

## Chapter 4: When Cooking Began

- While humans have been using fire for hundreds of thousands of years, archaeology doesn’t tell us when our ancestors began using fire.
- With the inability to use archaeological evidence to tell us when humans started to control fire, we turn to biology.
- There are two vital clues from biology
  - The fossil record paints a clear picture of the changes in human anatomy over the past two million years.
  - Our biology changes in response to our diet.
- Chimpanzees, when presented with raw and cooked food, always pick the cooked over the raw.
- Why do wild animals prefer cooked foods over raw foods?
- This preference for cooked foods implies an innate mechanism for recognizing high-energy foods.
- Cooked foods taste better by being sweeter and less bitter.
- The species implicated with the start of cooking is Homo erectus at 1.8 million years ago.
- There are two pieces of evidence that Homo erectus started cooking
  - Anatomical changes related to diet.
  - The loss of traits related to climbing.

## Chapter 5: Brain Foods

- Our exceptional intelligence is the defining feature of our species and yet its origins have long been a puzzle.
- There appears to be a link between brain size and social relationships.
- E.g. Dolphins, elephants, hyenas, crows, and ants.
- This is also known as the social brain hypothesis: large brains evolved because intelligence is a vital component of social life.
- It also explains why species with bigger brains tend to have more complex societies.
- If social intelligence is so important, then why do some group-living species have smaller brains than others?
- Diet provides a major part of the answer.
- The first requirement for evolving a big brain is the ability to fuel it and to do so reliably.
- We are physiologically similar to primates with the only exception being our gut size and brain.
- Gut size is linked to the quality of the diet since high energy-dense foods require smaller guts to digest.
- Our small gut size provides the answer to what body part was traded off for a larger brain.
- Primates that spend less energy fueling their guts can afford to power more brain tissue.
- This is also known as the expensive tissue hypothesis: big brains are made possible by reducing expensive tissue such as gut tissue.
- The first increase in brain size is attributed to eating meat, and the second increase is attributed to cooking.

## Chapter 6: How Cooking Frees Men

- Cooking made possible the sexual division of labor.
- Sexual division refers to how women and men perform different yet complementary tasks.
- The gendered division of labor is universal among humans.
- Women and men spend their days seeking different kinds of food, but the foods they obtain are eaten by both sexes which is unusual.
- Other animals usually don’t share their food with others but we are an exception.
- The human family is the result of the reciprocity of hunting and gathering as women share what they’ve gathered and men share what they’ve hunted.
- Since women gather roots and fruits, they can guarantee that their will be food for dinner while  men go hunt for more exquisite and energy-dense foods like meat.
- Another benefit of cooking is that it frees up time that would’ve been spent eating.
- Chimpanzees spend more than six hours a day chewing while humans spend less than an hour a day chewing.
- This reduction in chewing time is due to cooked foods being softer.
- E.g. Boiling potatoes makes them softer, slow cooking tough meat makes it more tender, and frying fish turns the meat flaky.
- Cooking frees up time for us to do other things.

## Chapter 7: The Married Cook

- Data collected from 185 cultures around the world shows that women tend to cook for the household. There were only three exceptions where women didn’t do the majority of cooking.
- The rule that cooking is women's work is consistent across the vast majority of human societies.
- Why is that? It's because when women cook it solves a basic problem.
- The problem is that women need protection to cook and men provide this protection.
- Men also get the bonus of guaranteeing their own meal as the woman cooks for the both of them.
- Cooking also has the cultural effect of preventing people from stealing as a man can expect food from his wife which means he won't steal another woman’s meal.
- Another interesting element of cooking is that if a single woman shares her food with a single man, they are regarded as married since she cooked for him.
- While women are forced to cook by men, it isn’t completely one-sided.
- Women feed men to reward them for behaving well.
- Food seems to drive a man's marriage decision more than the need for a sexual partner.

## Chapter 8: The Cook’s Journey

- Cooked foods being softer means mothers can wean their baby off earlier.
- This leads to faster recovery for the mother, a faster growing baby, and faster baby turnover.
- Fire also has the benefit of keeping us warm which might explain why we are naked compared to other primates.
