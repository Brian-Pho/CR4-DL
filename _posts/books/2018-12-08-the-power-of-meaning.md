# The Power of Meaning

## Introduction

- What is the meaning of existence?
- How can I lead a meaningful life?
- Psychologists help people overcome their demons, but it isn't the same as helping them live well.
- Although it would be best to have both happiness and depth, we would give up some happiness in order to gain depth.
- Nozick Matrix thought experiment.
- There is more to life than feeling happy.
- Hedonia vs Eudaimonia. Happiness VS meaning.
- Happiness as a positive mental and emotional state.
- Feelings are fleeting.
- Meaningful lives: they evaluate their lives as significant and worthwhile - as part of something bigger; they believe their lives make sense; and they feel their lives are driven by a sense of purpose.
- Happy people are takers, meaningful people are givers.
- They crafted lives that matter.

## Chapter 1: The Meaning Crisis

- On the Meaning of Life by Durant
- Wealthier nations had significantly higher suicide rates than poorer countries.
- Happier and unhappiness did not predict suicide.
- So what? Why? 
- With meaning no longer imposed on us from an outside source, we have the freedom to create it for ourselves.
- When we devote ourselves to difficult but worthwhile tasks, our lives feel more significant.
- There are four pillars to meaning: belonging, purpose, storytelling, and transcendence.

## Chapter 2: Belonging

- People feel like they belong when two conditions are satisfied.
- First, they're in relationships with others based on mutual care.
- Second, they have frequent pleasant interactions with other people.
- People naturally grow to like others whom they see regularly.
- Our culture makes it easy to dismiss potential friends or partners based on a single interaction.
- People are more likely to befriend those with whom they share common experiences and values.
- Many of us are so caught up in our own lives that we acknowledge the people we are interacting with only instrumentally, as a means to an end.
- I didn't accept his kindness.He wanted to do something meaningful but I treated it as a transaction.
- Social rejection can make both the rejected and the rejector feel alienated and insignificant.
- The most common way the cleaners felt devalued was by being ignored.
- High quality connection
- Close relationships and high quality connections have an important feature I common: both require us to focus on others.
- Compassion and empathy lie at the center of the pillar of belonging.
- If we want to find meaning in our own lives, we have to begin by reaching out.

## Chapter 3: Purpose

- Some people are willing to sacrifice pay, time, comfort, and status because they believe they have a duty to use their gifts.
- Purpose has two important dimensions.
- One, purpose is a "stable and far-reaching" goal.
- Most of our goals are mundane, but purpose, by contrast, is a goal towards which we are always working.
- Two, purpose involves a contribution to the world.
- A quarter of the emerging adults were "disengaged, expressing virtually no purpose."
- But living your dream is not necessarily the same thing as finding your purpose.
- Living purposefully requires self reflection and self knowledge.
- What kind of person am I and what kind of person do I want to be?
- A purpose driven person is ultimately concerned not with personal benefits but with making the world a better place.
- Good Will Hunting construction scene.
- Yet no matter what occupies our days, when we reframe our tasks as opportunities to help others, our lives and our work feel more significant.

## Chapter 4: Storytelling

- The stories should come from scars and not wounds.
- Storytelling is an act of creation which is the composition of our lives.By taking the disparate pieces of our lives and placing them together into a narrative, we create a unified whole that allows us to understand our lives as coherent.
- Storytelling emerges from our need to make sense of the world.To add a layer of meaning.
- People who are driven to contribute to society and to future generations are more likely to tell redemptive stories, stories that go from bad to good.
- Counterfactual thinking - imagining what if some pivotal moment in your life didn't happen.
- It would've been an easier life, but would've it been a better life?
- The world isn't just the way it is, it's also how we understand it.

## Chapter 5: Transcendence

- A transcendent experience is one in which we feel that we have risen above the everyday world to experience a higher reality.
- Mystical experiences share four qualities.
  - Passive
  - Transient

- Transcendence causes people to feel more connected to the universe and not fear death.
