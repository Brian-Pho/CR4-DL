## Part One: Foundations

---

### Chapter One: Neuroscience: Past, Present, Future

- There tends to be a correlation between structure (form) and function. Differences in appearance predict differences in function.
- Mind-Brain Problem: Is the mind separate from the brain? Neuroscience suggests no.
- The bumps (gyri) and grooves (sulci and fissures) are identified in every person. (like how the maze pattern shows up on hosts in WestWorld)
- Nerves as wires. They're one-way due to the refractory period. PNS (Peripheral Nervous System) bundles them together to output muscle control and input sensory data. (Why not have one two way neuron?)
- Cerebrum = Front
- Cerebellum = Back
- Localization of specific functions to different parts of the brain.
- Experimental abalation method: systematically destroy parts of the brain to determine their function.
- The evolution of nervous systems. Same behavior across species and since behavior reflects the activity of the nervous system, infer brain mechanisms may be similar across species.
- The neurons, basic functional unit of the brain.
- Levels of Analysis
  1. Molecular
  2. Cellular
  3. Systems
  4. Behavioral
  5. Cognitive
- Observation → Replication → Interpretation → Verification
- Publish or perish in the scientific community.

### Chapter Two:  Neurons and Gila

- There are approximately 85 billion neurons and glial cells in the brain.
- Nissl stain: stains nuclei and material surrounding the nuclei of neurons.
- Nissl stains are used to distinguish neurons and glial, also used to study cytoarchitecture (cell architecture)
- Golgi stain: stains some neurons in its entirety but not other neurons. Is used to isolate neuron.
- Neurons have two parts
  - Cell body/Soma
  - Neurities (axons and dendrites)
- Cell body usually has a single axon but many dendrites
- Axon (output)
  - Uniform diameter
  - Branches at 90 degrees
  - Very long (Could be greater than 1 meter)
  - Acts as wires
- Dendrites (input)
  - Short (Less than 2 mm)
  - Taper to a fine point
  - Acts as antennae
- Neurons communicate by contact, not continuous (Why not? Why do synapses exist?)
- Neuron = Nerve cell
- Soma, dendrities, axon, neuronal membrane (used to separate the outside of the cell from inside)
- Soma
  - Spherical
  - Fluid inside = Cytosol (Salty, potassium rich)
  - Standard organelles
  - Cytoplasm = Everything but the nucleus
  - Nucleus
    - DNA → Genes → Chromosome
    - Letter → Word → Sentence
    - DNA → (transcription) mRNA → (translation) Protein
- Protein synthesis of rough ER vs free ribosome?
  - Destined to be in the cytosol of neuron, then free ribosome
  - Destined to be inserted into the membrane of cell/organelle, then rough ER
- Neuronal membrane has different protein composition depending on if it's the soma, dendrite, or axon.
- The function of neurons cannot be understood without understanding the structure and function of the membrane and its associated protein.
- Axon
  - Axon hillock: region that tapers away from the soma
  - No rough ER
  - Protein composition is fundamentally different than soma membrane
  - No protein synthesis occurs in the axon. Hence, some mechanism for protein synthesis occurs in the soma and moves the protein to the synaptic terminal.
  - Protein molecules move down the axon in two ways, slow and fast axoplasmic transport (why two systems?)
  - Axon branches = Axon collaterals
  - Occasionally, an axon collateral returns to the same cell, called recurrent collaterals.
  - The diameter of the axon affects the speed of the electrical signal (nerve impulse). Thicker = Faster
  - End of axon = Axon terminal
  - Axon terminals form synapses with the dendrites/somata of other neurons or self.
- Synapses
  - Presynaptic: The side of the synapse that sends the action potential.
  - Postsynaptic: The side of the synapse that receives the action potential.
  - Information/neurotransmitters go from the presynaptic synapse to the postsynaptic synapse.
  - [Reasons for existence](https://www.quora.com/What-are-synapses-and-why-are-they-important):
    - Computation: Used to individually weigh the impact of all the different input channels. (Integration, summation, filtering)
    - Signals: They make sure that the flow of impulses is only in one direction.
    - Filtering: They place an upper limit on the frequency of depolarization.
- Neuron/Neurites classes
  - Anaxoinc: star shaped
  - Unipolar: Both the axon and dendrite are the same line
  - Bipolar: The axon and dendrite are separated by the soma
  - Multipolar: Many dendrites connected to the soma with an axon exiting the soma
- Innvervate: when a neuron makes synaptic contact with another cell
- Dendrites
  - Stellate cells: star shaped
  - Pyramidal cells: pyramid shaped
  - Spiny vs aspinous
  - Dendritic spines: receives synaptic input
- Neurons
  - Sensory
  - Motor
  - Interneuron
- Axon length
  - Golgi Type I (projection): long neurons
  - Golgi Type II (local circuit): short neurons

### Chapter Three: The Neuronal Membrane at Rest

- Nerve impulse/action potential (AP)
  - Doesn't diminish over distance
  - Information is encoded in the frequency of APs as well as the in the distribution and number of neurons firing APs in a given neuron.
  - Thoughts: APs encode information but we don't need APs to store information. E.g. One brain region may not be active but when APs are send through it information is retrieved somehow from someplace.
- Channel proteins (Ion channels): allows certain ions to pass through the membrane.
- Ion pumps: uses ATP to transport certain ions across the membrane.
- The inside of neuronal membrane is negatively charged.

### Chapter Four: The Action Potential

- Action potential (nerve impulse, spike): the rapid reversal of polarization where the inside of the membrane becomes positive. (why?)
- Frequency + Pattern dictates the code used by neurons to transfer information
- APs last approximately 2 milliseconds
- APs are caused by the depolarization of the membrane beyond threshold.
- If passed continuous depolarizing current into a neuron, we generate many APs in succession.
- The rate of AP generation depends on the magnitude of the continuous depolarizing current.
- The firing frequency of APs reflects the magnitude of the depolarizing current.
- Max firing frequency is approximately 1000 Hz or 1 msec, known as the refractory period.
- Ion pumps work continuously to establish and maintain the concentration gradient.
- APs are generated by the movement of ions through the channels that are gated by changes in the membrane potential.
- APs propagate in only one direction due to refractory.
- Normally APs go from the soma to the axon terminal
- Like a hose with holes, AP conduction velocity increases with bigger axonal diameter. (Due to more ions that can travel down the axon than out. Greater increase in volume than surface area.)
- Smaller axons require greater depolarization to reach AP threshold
- Myelin sheath blocks ions from entering/leaving thus speeding up APs (to overcome using fatter axons for speed)
- Dendrites don't have/generate APs
- Axon hillock is approximately the spike-initiation zone

### Chapter Five: Synaptic Transmission

- Moving from intra-neuron (within a neuron) to inter-neuron (between neurons)
- Voltage gated ion channels are where the threshold voltage comes from
- Synaptic transmission: the process of information transfer at a synapse
- Synapse: specialized junction where one part of a neuron contacts and communicates with another neuron. Generally in one direction.
- Chemical synapse: transfer of information using chemical neurotransmitters
- Electrical synapse: allows direct transfer of ionic current (at gap junctions)
- Connexin → Connexon → Gap Junction
- Electrical synapses are bi-directional
- Useful for synchronization
- Chemical synapses are separated by the synaptic cleft filled by fibrous protein to "glue" pre/post synapses.
- Synaptic vesicles: stores neurotransmitters
- Active zone → synaptic cleft →Postsynaptic density
- Post synaptic density: contains neurotransmitter receptors to convert intercellular signal into intracellular signal.
- Chemical neurotransmitter classes
  1. Amino acid
  2. Amines
  3. Peptides
- Excitatory: bring voltage closer to threshold
- Inhibitory: brings voltage away from threshold
- The same neurotransmitter can have different postsynaptic actions depending on what receptors bind to it.
- The transformation of many synaptic input to a single neuronal output constitutes a neural computation.
- Synaptic integration: the process by which multiple synaptic potentials combine within one postsynaptic neuron.
- Excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP): [TODO]
- Inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP): [TODO]
- Postsynaptic EPSP are quantized (discrete)
- EPSP summation:
  - Spatial summation: add together EPSPs generated simultaneously at many different synapses on a dendrite.
  - Temporal summation: add together EPSPs generated at the same synapse if they occur in rapid succession.
- The effectiveness of an excitatory synapse depends on how far the synapse is from the spike-initiation zone (distance matters)
- Shunting inhibition: removes depolarizing current before it reaches soma (location of the synapse on the dendrite matters)
- Modulation: doesn't invoke EPSP/IPSP but instead modifies the effectiveness of EPSP

### Chapter Six: Neurotransmitter Systems

- Mostly on in-depth neurotransmitters so skipping (I will regret this later)
- Divergence: the ability of one transmitter to activate more than one subtype of receptor
- Divergence is the rule among neurotransmitters
- Convergence: multiple neurotransmitters can converge to influence the same effector system
- Neurons integrate divergent and convergent signalling systems
- The signaling network within a single neuron resembles the neural networks of the brain themselves
- The information is recombined in more than simple summation.

### Chapter Seven: The Structure of the Nervous System

- Anatomical references
  - Anterior (front)
  - Posterior (back)
  - Dorsal (up)
  - Ventral (down)
  - Left
  - Right
- The nervous system is divided into two parts, the CNS and PNS.
  - Central Nervous System (CNS): the brain and spinal cord
  - Peripheral Nervous System (PNS): nerves in the body that aren't part of the CNS
- The PNS can be subdivided into two parts
  - Somatic (voluntary control)
  - Visceral (involuntary control)
- Afferent (carry to)
- Efferent (carry from)
- Cerebral cortex: thin sheet of neurons just under the surface of the cerebrum. Seat for human reasoning and cognition.
- Cortex: any collection of neurons that forms a thin sheet
- Cerebral cortex features
  - Layers (6)
  - Neocortex found only in mammals

## Part Two: Sensory and Motor Systems

---

### Chapter Eight: The Chemical Senses

- Chemical sensation is the oldest and most pervasive across species
- The neural information from both taste and smell are porcessed in parallel and are merged at rather high levels in the cerebral cortex
- Transduction: environmental stimuli causes an electrical response in a sensory receptor cell
- Labeled line hypothesis: that sensory neurons in the body have a "straight line" right up to the cortex. That there are "sweet" neurons in the brain.
- Population coding: the responses of a large number of broadly tuned neurons, rather than a small number of precisely tuned neurons, are used to specify the properties of a particular stimulus (how the brain combines signals from various sources) (Hinton's capsules routing by agreement)
- Two problems
  - How to encode information
  - How to combine information
- Unlike taste receptor cells, smell receptors are genuine neurons
- The olfactory response may terminate by removing the odorant particles, broken down the mucus, etc.
- Even in the continuing presence of the receptor cell, the strength of the smell may fade due to adaptation.
- How does the cell convert from the top potentials to the bottom potentials? Derivatives? (In reference to the picture above [TODO])
- How does a neuron convert a constant signal into a series of potential spikes?
- Another demonstration that biology is conservative and evolution recycles its good ideas. Smelling and seeing use some similar molecular mechanisms
- Smelling also uses population code to combine signals
- Olfactory receptor neurons map to specific glomeruli [TODO]
- Olfaction is unique since all other sensory systems first pass information through the thalamus before projecting it to the cerebral cortex
- In smell, there is an apparent paradox similar to the one in taste. Individual receptors are broadly tuned to their simuli; that is, each cell is sensitive to a wide variety of chemicals. (why? adaptable?) However, when we smell those same chemicals, we can easily tell them apart. How is the whole brain doing what single olfactory cells cannot? We discuss three important ideas (maybe more?)
1. Olfactory Population Coding: each odor is represented by the activity of a large population of neurons.
    - By looking at the combination of responses from all of the cells, the brain could distinguish the smell.
    - How does it combine? Population coding (Arrow's theorem? Winner takes all? Is this the basis for bias? How does smell bias for 80% bad smells?)
2. Olfactory Maps: the neurons responsive to particular odors may be organized into spatial maps.
    - An orderly arrangement of neurons that correlates with certain features of the environment. Experiments reveal tht while a particular oder activates many bulb neurons, the neuron's positions form complex but reproducible spatial patterns.
    - Olfactory bulb does quite a bit of information processing and synaptic integration. Perhaps the consciousness from the neocortex just interprets these basic results from smaller processing units. (why is the neocortex so thin but so vital?)
    - Every sensory system uses spatial maps
      - Visual system: map of visual space
      - Auditory system: map of sound frequency
      - Sensory system: map of sound frequency
      - The maps of the chemical senses are unusual in that the stimuli themselves have no meaningful spatial properties.
    - Seeing = what and where, smell is only what, not where. The most critical feature of each odorant is its chemical structure, not its position in space. Because the olfactory system doesn't have to map the spatial pattern of an odor in the same way that the visual system has to map the spatial patterns of light, neural odor maps may have other functions, such as discrimination among a huge number of different chemicals.
    - How do these maps form? Are they consistent between people? Aka is my "pizza" smell the same as your "pizza" smell? Is my read the same as your red?
    - Unknown and unsure of mapping actually encodes odors or not (further research is needed)
3. Temporal Coding in the Olfactory System: the timing of APs may be an essential code for particular odors.
    - Temporal coding
    - Temporal patterns are evident in the spatial odor maps as they sometimes change shape during the presentation of a single odor.
    - Odor information is encoded by the detailed timing of spikes within cells as well as by the number, temporal pattern, rhythmicity, and cell-to-cell synchrony of spikes.

### Chapter Nine: The Eye

- Retina is specialized to detect differences in the intensity of light falling on different parts of it.
- Image processing happens in the retina before the brain
- The brain must do mirror/reflection because the image falls onto the retina backwards
- Ganglion cells fire APs regardless of exposure to light or not
- Ganglion cells appear to be mainly responsive to differences in the illumination that occur within their receptive fields.
- Ganglion cells receptive fields act like the "pixels" of the eye. It detects changes in light.
- Edge detection happens at the level of the retina? Optical illusions explained.
- The center-surround organization of the receptive fields leads to the neural response that emphasizes the contrast at light-dark edges.
- Parallel processing in the visual system. Two eyes. Ganglion cells.

### Chapter Ten: The Central Visual System

- Retina extracts information about differences in brightness and color
- 100 million photoreceptors → 1 million axons
- Lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus and the primary visual cortex (area 17, V1, striate cortex)
- Remember to get the space between photoreceptors (resolution) and find out how many photoreceptors per ganglion cell (size of convolution path)
- Retinofugal: optic nerve that leaves the eye
- The optic nerves cross so the image from right sides of each eye goes to the right brain.
- Couldn't you temporarily disable a neuron by preventing the flow of ions via an electric/magnetic field? Less harmful than experimental abalation.
- The visual receptive fields of LGN neurons are almost identical to those of the ganglion cells that feed them. Information is still separate and processed in parallel.
- About 80% of input to LGN is actually the primary visual cortex.
- Retinotopy: neighboring cells in the retina feed information to neighboring places in their target structure (current ANN don't have neurons in each layer talk to other neurons within that same layer)
- Most V1 neurons have orientation selectivity
- Rows of neurons = Different angle
- Column of neurons = Same angle
- Direction-selective cells are a subset of orientation selective cells
- Orientation-selective neurons are thought to be specialized for the analysis of object shape
- Direction-selective neurons are thought to be specialized for the analysis of object motion
- Believed that neurons specialized to be sensitive to wavelength are important for the analysis of object color

### Chapter Eleven: The Auditory and Vestibular Systems

- Create AI without sight, only sound + cognitive functions
- Auditory receptors in cochlea
  - Brain stem neurons
  - MGN
  - Auditory cortex (A1)
- Encoding Sound Intensity and Sound Frequency
  - Two interrelated ways
    - Firing rates of neurons
    - Number of active neurons
  - Intensity → More polarized → Greater firing rates
  - Frequency is represented by tonotopy: mechanics of the basilar membrane.
  - However, there must be another way since no maps for greater than 200 Hz sounds
  - Phase locking: the consistent firing of a cell at the same phase of a sound wave
- It's likely that intermediate sound frequencies are represented by the pooled activity of a number of neurons, each of which fires in a phase-locked manner; known as the volley principle
- Phase-locking only used up to 5 kHz due to sound waves cycling too fast
- The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
- Sound Localization
  - Use different techniques for locating horizontal plane (L/R) verses vertical plane (U/D)
  - Example: close one ear, up/down is easy, left/right is harder
  - Interaural time delay: time difference between ears
  - Precision of 2 degrees (11 microseconds) aka the ear's resolution
  - Continuous sounds are harder to locate
  - Use the interaural delay of the peak in the wave to determine sound location
  - Continuous tones at high frequencies don't use peaks because it's too fast
  - Instead use interaural intensity difference
  - Duplex theory of sound localization (time delay + intensity difference)
  - Binaural neurons input from both ears
  - Use length of axons (delay lines) to get/calculate time difference
  - Ear flaps used for vertical localization

### Chapter Twelve: The Somatic Sensory System

- Somatic sensory: touch, temperature, pain, body position (proprioception)
- Skin sensitivity: dot of 0.006 mm deep, 0.04 mm wide (skin resolution)
- Lateral inhibition: neighboring nerve cells inhibit one another
- Places on the body can be mapped to specific areas on the brain called somatopic map
- Cortical maps are dynamic and adjust depending on the amount of sensory experience (plasticity)
- Common theme: several flows of related, but distinct, information are passed in parallel through a series of neural structures. The mixing of these streams occurs along the way, but only judiciously, until higher levels of processing are reached in the cerebral cortex.
- Exactly how the parallel streams of sensory data are melded into perception, images, ideas, and memories remains the Holy Grail of neuroscience.

### Chapter Thirteen: Spinal Control of Movement

- CNS controls muscle contraction is by varying the firing rates of motor neurons
- Muscles with a large number of small motor units can be more finely controlled by the CNS
- Size principle: orderly recruitment of motor neurons is due to variation in alpha motor neuron size
- Neurons switch phenotype (physical characteristics) as a consequence of synaptic activity
- What makes our brain physically different from other animal brains?
- The circuit for the coordinated control of walking must reside within the spinal cord.
- Circuits that give rise to the rhythmic motor activity are called central pattern generators

### Chapter Fourteen: Brain Control of Movement

- Central Motor System Hierarchy
  1. Association areas of neocortex/basal ganglia (strategy: goal of the movement)
  2. Motor cortex/Cerebellum (tactics: the sequence of muscle contractions)
  3. Brain stem/Spinal code (execution: activation of the motor neurons)
- Follow Alan Turing's advice and build a machine mimicking a child
- Area 6 lies at the junction where signals encoding what actions are converted into signals that specify how the actions will be carried out
- Mirror neurons: seems to encode the specific goals of motor acts rather than particular sensory stimuli (it's a monkey see monkey do neuron)(neural basis of empathy and one-shot learning?)
- Population coding also used to control muscle movements
- M1 commanding voluntary movement:
  1. Much of the motor cortex is active for every movement
  2. The activity of each cell represents a single "vote" for a particular direction of movement
  3. The direction of movement is determined by a tally (and averaging) of the votes registered by each cell in the population
- This leads to the prediction: the larger the population of neurons representing a type of movement, the finer the possible control
- Neural plasticity: different neurons take over the job of other neurons
- Cerebellum: what what is intended is compared with what has happened

## Part Three: The Brain and Behavior

---

### Chapter Fifteen: Chemical Control of the Brain and Behavior

- What if you did population coding on the population coding of sensory systems?
- Our sense of time is derived from the time it takes to clear neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft (few milliseconds)
- Hypothalamus: integrates somatic and visceral responses in accordance with the needs of the brain
- Chapter is mostly on hormone regulation so skimmed it

### Chapter Sixteen: Motivation

- Motivation can be thought of as a driving force on behavior
- Electrical self-stimulation appeared to provide a reward that reinforced the habit
- The most effective sites for self-stimulation fell along the trajectory of dopaminergic axons
- The activity of dopamine neurons signals errors in reward prediction. Events that are "better than expected" cause dopamine neurons to come to life. "Worse than expected" resulted in inhibition. "As expected" resulted in no change.
- Dopamine is intimately involved in the mechanism behind this learning
- Figure 16.18: that looks like temporal summation
- Connecting the "how" and the "why" of behavior has been difficult
- One of the great triumphs of human evolution is the ability to exert cognitve, cortical control over our more primitive instincts.
- Neuroeconomics
- Executive functions

### Chapter Seventeen: Sex and the Brain

- Skipping as chapter relates to sex and gender
- Not relevant to AI as both sexes can be intelligent

### Chapter Eighteen: Brain Mechanisms of Emotion

- Emotional experience (feelings) vs emotional expression, is there a difference?
- James-Lange theory: we experience emotions in response to physiological changes in our body. Not quite true as not all emotions are physical
- Cannon-Bard theory: that emotional experience can occur independently of emotional expression
- Can listen to music but also talk to myself at the same time
- Neither theory is right
- Unconscious emotion: what else is the brain doing without us knowing?

### Chapter Nineteen: Brain Rhythms and Sleep

- EEG measures electrical activity from the surface of the scalp.
- Specifically, an EEG measures voltages generated by the currents that flow during synaptic excitation of the dendrites of many pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex
- The amplitude of the EEG signal strongly depends on how synchronous in activity of the underlying neurons
- When the cortex is most engaged with processing info, the activity level of cortical neurons is relatively high but also relatively unsynchronized
- Generation of synchronous patterns:
  - They all take commands from a central leader
  - They share/distribute the timing function among themselves
- Seizure: extreme form of synchronous brain activity
- Sleep is a readily reversible state of reduced responsiveness to, and interaction with, the environment
- Non-REM sleep: an idling brain in a moveable body
- REM sleep: active, hallucinating brain in a paralyzed body (dreaming)

### Chapter Twenty: Language

- Language: a system for representing and communicating information that uses words combined according to grammatical rules
- Distinguish between language, thought, and intelligence
- Language is not a requirement for intelligence nor thought (how many traits can we reduce until something isn't intelligent? Is this possible?)
- Spoken language doesn't reliably indicate the division between words (like text but without spaces)
- Infants use statistical learning (some combinations of sounds are more likely than others)
- Multilinguals may have the languages in overlapping areas
- Corpus callosum: largest bundle of axons connecting the right and left cerebral hemispheres
- Cutting corpus callosum results in no noticeable effects except it seems like you have two brains

### Chapter Twenty-One: The Resting Brain, Attention, and Consciousness

- Attention: the ability to focus on one aspect of sensory input (preferentially process some information and ignore the rest)
- Consciousness: awareness of something
- Attention and consciousness are separate
- Resting state activity: some regions are active, some aren't
- Default mode network: areas of the brain that are active when no overt task
- Bottom-up attention: a stimulus attracts our attention without any cognitive input
- Top-down attention: attention is deliberately directed by the brain to something
- Easy problems of consciousness: phenomena answerable by standard scientific methodology
- Hard problem of consciousness: the experience itself
- Top-down attention = consciousness?

### Chapter Twenty-Two: Mental Illness

- Skipping notes due to being on mental illness

## Part Four: The Changing Brain

---

### Chapter Twenty-Three: Wiring the Brain

- 85 billion neurons in the brain
- Retina → LGN → Cortex
- Six cortical layers
- Neuronal structure develops in three major stages
  1. Cell Proliferation
  2. Cell Migration
  3. Cell Differentiation
- Cell Proliferation
- Two zones
  - Ventricular: inside of vesicle
  - Marginal: zone facing outside
- Radial glial cells: gives rise to all neurons and astrocytes of the cerebral cortex
- Symmetrical cell division: both daughter cells remain in the ventricular zone
- Asymmetrical cell division: the farthest away causes further division and migrates away
- Vast majority of neurons created between 5th week and 5th month
- Once a daughter cell commits to a neuronal fate, it will never divide again
- Most parts of the brain, the neurons you're born with, are all you will have in your lifetime
- Pyramid and start (astrocyte) neurons in the brain
- Cortical layers are built top-to-bottom
- Neocortex: patchwork quilt, specialized areas
- Surface area of brain is much bigger than volume
- Large scale reduction of neurons/synapses when growing up
- Cell death reflects competition for trophic factors, life-sustaining substances that are limited
- Synaptic capacity: on the dendrites/soma a finite number of synapses
- Synaptic capacity sharply declines in teen years
- Synaptic rearrangement: synapses are reorganized
- Synaptic rearrangement occurs as a consequence of neural activity and synaptic transmission
- Synaptic rearrangement isn't just activity dependent but also experience dependent
- Vision doesn't use a "use it or lose it" strategy but a competition based one
- Synaptic plasticity
  - Neurons that fire together wire together
  - Neurons that fire out of sync lose their link
  - Hebb Rule is a correlation

### Chapter Twenty-Four: Memory Systems

- Different brain lesions affect different types of remembered information, suggesting that there's more than one memory system (confirmation bias?)
- Learning: acquisition of new knowledge/skills
- Memory: retention of learned info
  1. Declarative: conscious
  2. Nondeclarative: unconscious
- Formation of procedural memory in two ways
  - Associative Learning
    - Behavior is altered by the formation of associations
  - Nonassociated Learning
    - Habituation
    - Sensitization
- Temporal lobe important for memory
- Medial TL critical for memory consolidation but not for memory retrieval
- Hippocampus appears to play a critical role in binding sensory information for memory consolidation
- Hippocampus supports spatial memory of object locations
- Hippocampus stores memories but for an unknown period of time
- Place cell: cells that only fire when at a specific place
- Grid cell: when at multiple locations that form a hexagonal grid, they fire
- When we recall a memory, it becomes susceptible to change and reconsolidation
- Striatum may play a role in procedural memory
- Engram: hypothetical permanent change in the brain
- Consolidation: the action/process of making something stronger, turning a short term memory into a long term memory

### Chapter Twenty-Five: Molecular Mechanisms of Learning and Memory

- The synapse is an important site of information storage
- Learning and memory in two stages
  1. Acquisition of a short term memory
  2. Consolidation of a long term memory
- Learning occurs by a physical modification of the brain (is this true?) by incoming sensory information
- Memory consolidation: the process by which some experiences, held temporarily, are selected for permanent storage in long term memory
- Not all memories are created equal
- Experience → (Memory acquisition) Short Term Memory → (Memory Consolidation) → Long Term Memory
  - Looks like DNA copying
- IT = Inferotemporal cortex
- IT appears to be both a visual area and involved in memory storage (of faces)
- IT neurons are stimulus selective
- Distributed memory: the memory is stored across multiple neurons
- Graceful degradation: the blending of representations together as neurons are lost
- Long Term Potentiation (LTP): induced by tetanus (brief burst of high-frequency stimulation) [TODO]
- Long Term Depression (LTD): [TODO]
- Input specificity: only the active inputs show the synaptic plasticity
- High frequency stimulation isn't required for LTP, what's required is that "synapses be active at the same time that the postsynaptic CA1 neuron is strongly depolarized"
- In order to achieve that necessary depolarization with a tetanus
  - Synapses must be stimulated at frequencies high enough to cause temporal summation of the EPSP (concurrent)
  - Synapses must be active simultaneously to cause spatial summation of the EPSP (aka cooperative)
- BCM Theory: an extension of Hebb's theory to account for bidirectional regulation of synaptic strength
  - Synapses will undergo synaptic weakening, instead of LTP when they're active at the same time the postsynaptic cell is only weakly depolarized by other inputs
- Bidirectional plasticity of many cortical neurons rules
  - Synaptic transmission occurring at the same time as strong depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron causes LTP of the active synapses
  - Synaptic transmission occurring at the same time as weak/modest depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron causes LTD of the active synapses
- Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity: when postsynaptic spikes consistently follow the EPSPs induced, the synapse grows stronger. When it consistently precedes the EPSPs, the synapse grows weaker
- LTP/LTD may be the basis for one-shot learning
- Unchecked synaptic plasticity can lead to unstable neuronal responses (overfitting?)
- Metaplasticity: synaptic plasticity changes depending on the history of synaptic activity
- Synaptic modification threshold: the level between what is required for LTP/LTD causes no net change
- Ongoing adjustments of the value of the modification threshold ensures that synaptic modifications are constrained to maintain neuronal stimulus selectivity and memory
- Denervation supersensitivity: cutting/blocking a nerve leads to an increase in the excitability and sensitivity
- Synaptic scaling: adjustment of absolute synaptic effectiveness that preserves the relative distributions of synaptic weights
- Negative feedback loop: metaplasticity + scaling keeps a lid on synaptic plasticity
- TODO. Pg 892, the problems with phosphorylation are the traits of short term memory
- Synaptic tagging and capture: the persistence of LTP depends on whether synaptic stimulation is strong enough to trigger protein synthesis in the postsynaptic neuron
- The modulation of gene expression by CREB provides a molecular mechanism that can control the strength of memory
