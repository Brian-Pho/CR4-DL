## Part One: Foundations

---

### Chapter One: Neuroscience: Past, Present, Future

- There tends to be a correlation between structure (form) and function. Differences in appearance predict differences in function.
- Mind-Brain Problem: Is the mind separate from the brain? Neuroscience suggests no.
- The bumps (gyri) and grooves (sulci and fissures) are identified in every person. (like how the maze pattern shows up on hosts in WestWorld)
- Nerves as wires. They're one-way due to the refractory period. PNS (Peripheral Nervous System) bundles them together to output muscle control and input sensory data. (Why not have one two way neuron?)
- Cerebrum = Front
- Cerebellum = Back
- Localization of specific functions to different parts of the brain.
- Experimental abalation method: systematically destroy parts of the brain to determine their function.
- The evolution of nervous systems. Same behavior across species and since behavior reflects the activity of the nervous system, infer brain mechanisms may be similar across species.
- The neurons, basic functional unit of the brain.
- Levels of Analysis
  1. Molecular
  2. Cellular
  3. Systems
  4. Behavioral
  5. Cognitive
- Observation → Replication → Interpretation → Verification
- Publish or perish in the scientific community.

### Chapter Two:  Neurons and Gila

- There are approximately 85 billion neurons and glial cells in the brain.
- Nissl stain: stains nuclei and material surrounding the nuclei of neurons.
- Nissl stains are used to distinguish neurons and glial, also used to study cytoarchitecture (cell architecture)
- Golgi stain: stains some neurons in its entirety but not other neurons. Is used to isolate neuron.
- Neurons have two parts
  - Cell body/Soma
  - Neurities (axons and dendrites)
- Cell body usually has a single axon but many dendrites
- Axon (output)
  - Uniform diameter
  - Branches at 90 degrees
  - Very long (Could be greater than 1 meter)
  - Acts as wires
- Dendrites (input)
  - Short (Less than 2mm)
  - Taper to a fine point
  - Acts as antennae
- Neurons communicate by contact, not continuous (Why not? Why do synapses exist?)
- Neuron = Nerve cell
- Soma, dendrities, axon, neuronal membrane (used to separate the outside of the cell from inside)
- Soma
  - Spherical
  - Fluid inside = Cytosol (Salty, potassium rich)
  - Standard organelles
  - Cytoplasm = Everything but the nucleus
  - Nucleus
    - DNA → Genes → Chromosome
    - Letter → Word → Sentence
    - DNA → (transcription) mRNA → (translation) Protein
- Protein synthesis of rough ER vs free ribosome?
  - Destined to be in the cytosol of neuron, then free ribosome
  - Destined to be inserted into the membrane of cell/organelle, then rough ER
- Neuronal membrane has different protein composition depending on if it's the soma, dendrite, or axon.
- The function of neurons cannot be understood without understanding the structure and function of the membrane and its associated protein.
- Axon
  - Axon hillock: region that tapers away from the soma
  - No rough ER
  - Protein composition is fundamentally different than soma membrane
  - No protein synthesis occurs in the axon. Hence, some mechanism for protein synthesis occurs in the soma and moves the protein to the synaptic terminal.
  - Protein molecules move down the axon in two ways, slow and fast axoplasmic transport (why two systems?)
  - Axon branches = Axon collaterals
  - Occasionally, an axon collateral returns to the same cell, called recurrent collaterals.
  - The diameter of the axon affects the speed of the electrical signal (nerve impulse). Thicker = Faster
  - End of axon = Axon terminal
  - Axon terminals form synapses with the dendrites/somata of other neurons or self.
- Synapses
  - Presynaptic: The side of the synapse that sends the action potential.
  - Postsynaptic: The side of the synapse that receives the action potential.
  - Information/neurotransmitters go from the presynaptic synapse to the postsynaptic synapse.
- Neuron/Neurites classes
  - Anaxoinc: star shaped
  - Unipolar: Both the axon and dendrite are the same line
  - Bipolar: The axon and dendrite are separated by the soma
  - Multipolar: Many dendrites connected to the soma with an axon exiting the soma
- Innvervate: when a neuron makes synaptic contact with another cell
- Dendrites
  - Stellate cells: star shaped
  - Pyramidal cells: pyramid shaped
  - Spiny vs aspinous
  - Dendritic spines: receives synaptic input
- Neurons
  - Sensory
  - Motor
  - Interneuron
- Axon length
  - Golgi Type I (projection): long neurons
  - Golgi Type II (local circuit): short neurons

### Chapter Three: The Neuronal Membrane at Rest

- Nerve impulse/action potential (AP)
  - Doesn't diminish over distance
  - Information is encoded in the frequency of APs as well as the in the distribution and number of neurons firing APs in a given neuron.
  - Thoughts: APs encode information but we don't need APs to store information. E.g. One brain region may not be active but when APs are send through it information is retrieved somehow from someplace.
- Channel proteins (Ion channels): allows certain ions to pass through the membrane.
- Ion pumps: uses ATP to transport certain ions across the membrane.
- The inside of neuronal membrane is negatively charged.

### Chapter Four: The Action Potential

- Action potential (nerve impulse, spike): the rapid reversal of polarization where the inside of the membrane becomes positive. (why?)
- Frequency + Pattern dictates the code used by neurons to transfer information
- APs last approximately 2 milliseconds
- APs are caused by the depolarization of the membrane beyond threshold.
- If passed continuous depolarizing current into a neuron, we generate many APs in succession.
- The rate of AP generation depends on the magnitude of the continuous depolarizing current.
- The firing frequency of APs reflects the magnitude of the depolarizing current.
- Max firing frequency is approximately 1000 Hz or 1 msec, known as the refractory period.
- Ion pumps work continuously to establish and maintain the concentration gradient.
- APs are generated by the movement of ions through the channels that are gated by changes in the membrane potential.
- APs propagate in only one direction due to refractory.
- Normally APs go from the soma to the axon terminal
- Like a hose with holes, AP conduction velocity increases with bigger axonal diameter. (Due to more ions that can travel down the axon than out. Greater increase in volume than surface area.)
- Smaller axons require greater depolarization to reach AP threshold
- Myelin sheath blocks ions from entering/leaving thus speeding up APs (to overcome using fatter axons for speed)
- Dendrites don't have/generate APs
- Axon hillock is approximately the spike-initiation zone
