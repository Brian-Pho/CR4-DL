Synaptic plasticity is thought to be the basis of
learning and memory, but it is mostly studied on the timescale
of mere minutes. This review discusses synaptic consolidation,
a process that enables synapses to retain their
strength for a much longer time (days to years), instead
of returning to their original value. 

The process involves
specific plasticity-related proteins, and depends on the
dopamine D1/D5 receptors. Here, we review the research on
synaptic consolidation, describing electrophysiology
experiments, recent modeling work, as well as behavioral
correlates.
