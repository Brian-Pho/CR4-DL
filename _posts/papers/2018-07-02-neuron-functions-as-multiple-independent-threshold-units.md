Neurons are the computational elements that compose the brain and their fundamental principles
of activity are known for decades. According to the long-lasting computational scheme, each neuron
sums the incoming electrical signals via its dendrites and when the membrane potential reaches a
certain threshold the neuron typically generates a spike to its axon. Here we present three types
of experiments, using neuronal cultures, indicating that each neuron functions as a collection of
independent threshold units. The neuron is anisotropically activated following the origin of the arriving
signals to the membrane, via its dendritic trees. 

The first type of experiments demonstrates that a
single neuronâ€™s spike waveform typically varies as a function of the stimulation location. The second
type reveals that spatial summation is absent for extracellular stimulations from different directions.
The third type indicates that spatial summation and subtraction are not achieved when combining
intra- and extra- cellular stimulations, as well as for nonlocal time interference, where the precise
timings of the stimulations are irrelevant. Results call to re-examine neuronal functionalities beyond
the traditional framework, and the advanced computational capabilities and dynamical properties of
such complex systems.
