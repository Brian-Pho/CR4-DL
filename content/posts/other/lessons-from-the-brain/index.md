This page is an incomplete collection of brain findings and principles that may help us build AGI; lessons from the brain as it applies to AGI. Every time I run across an idea that triggers my sense of importance and utility, I will add it here. The table below maps neuroscience ideas to how we might implement it in AGI (I will organize the table at some point).

| Neuroscience | Source | AGI Suggestion |
|--------------|--------|-------------------------|
| We known more about the brain than we are lead to believe | All of neuroscience | A common saying is that "we don't know much about the brain" but this isn't true. Two centuries of neuroscience has lead to the development of a general understanding of the brain and how it works. We can use these general findings in the creation of AGI. |
| The brain is highly organized | All of neuroscience | The brain isn't a giant blob of cells but is organized into functional regions with specialized functions. Like any other organ, the design of the brain follows from selective pressures in evolution that lead to where it is today and we can exploit this organization to organize our knowledge of the brain. Textbooks have common and well defined tables of contents that divide the brain into functional components such as emotion and memory. |
| The brain has 86 billion neurons and is matched by none other in terms of the number of neurons in the cerebral cortex | [The Human Advantage](/books/the-human-advantage/) | We need to build devices of equivalent computing power. There's a low probability of a device with fewer units of computation but of equivalent intelligence. Neuromorphic chips may be the answer. |
| The brain has a surprisingly long development time compared to other animals | [Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience](/textbooks/developmental-cognitive-neuroscience-an-introduction/) | AGI should intentionally have a delayed maturation period in order to improve learning and adaptability. This may come in the form of slower learning rates, increase epochs, or the slow development of neural architecture. |
| Our best framework for cognitive development is interactive specialization, the idea that we start out with a general structure that becomes more refined over time and as we mature and develop | [Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience](/textbooks/developmental-cognitive-neuroscience-an-introduction/) / [Connectome](/books/connectome/) | AGI should start out with some general priors but not any specific ones, the general priors should enable further refinement and specialization of the network |
| Intelligence is dependent on consciousness | [The Feeling of What Happens](/books/the-feeling-of-what-happens/) | As evidence by cases of epileptic automatism, AGI be conscious to be intelligent. There needs to be some sense of self and identity to attribute feelings and knowledge to. Also related to Friston's [Free energy principle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIu_dJGyIQI). |
| Sparsity | [After Digital: Computation as Done by Brains and Machines](/textbooks/after-digital-computation-as-done-by-brains-and-machines/) | Computation in the brain doesn't use all neurons nor is it distributed. Computation appears to be sparse, requiring only a select fraction of neurons. The same principle appears for memories where it only activates a certain portion of neurons (engram). AGI should use sparse representations to be efficient and only use what's needed. |
| Representation | [Cognitive Science: An Introduction to the Science of the Mind](/textbooks/cognitive-science-an-introduction-to-the-science-of-the-mind/) | The idea of representation has shown up throughout most of the neuroscience textbooks that I've read and in ML. It's because the brain must make some copy of reality which we call representation, it represents reality. AGI will have to implement some form of representation that's efficient. |
| Representations serve the brain and not reality | [Magenta Is All In Your Head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRuPF6JtWdw) | Surprisingly, the brain can create colors that don't exist. For example, magenta is a color we perceive but doesn't map to any wavelength on the electromagnetic spectrum. This shows that the brain's representations aren't trying to accurately model reality, but that representations serve survival and the brain. |
| The brain has specialized areas dedicated to certain functions. | [Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain](/textbooks/neuroscience-exploring-the-brain/) | AGI should have specialized modules to handle functions such as language, vision, and audition. It should then combine them in association areas using a hierarchy organization. |
| Interleave between memory and computation | [Fundamentals of Computational Neuroscience](/textbooks/fundamentals-of-computational-neuroscience/) | There aren't any specific areas in the brain dedicated to computation or memory like in a computer. Both are interleaved in the brain in neurons and synapses. This leads to an efficient design of matching memory to where computation is needed. This also avoids the von Neumann bottleneck. |
| Interleave between digital and analog signal processing | [After Digital: Computation as Done by Brains and Machines](/textbooks/after-digital-computation-as-done-by-brains-and-machines/) | The brain uses analog processing in the form of graded temporal rates of APs to convey information such as faster firing for more muscle stretch and in the graded release of synaptic vesciles. However, the brain also uses digital processing in the form of all-or-nothing signals called action potentials. This is one of the weaker ideas that is too general to be applicable to AGI. |
| Refinement and synaptic pruning to make neural pathways shorter, faster, and more efficient | SciShowPsyc video / [Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain](/textbooks/neuroscience-exploring-the-brain/) | Pathways are the name of the game for neurons as neurons use the path that data travels to process it. A similar idea applies to neural networks where the follow of data along certain paths dictates the outcome of that data. Refinement and synaptic pruning provides one mechanism for the modification of pathways. |
| The meaning of neural signals is determined by the pathway | [Janet Casgard video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyowfgluQ6w) | What I believe to be the most neglected idea in neuroscience. When the brain receives an action potential from the body, how does it know it came from the arm or leg? The pathway of the action potential defines the meaning since all action potentials are stereotyped/similar. This also results in the somatotopic organization of the brain and spine. This translate into AGI as a new paradigm of programming. To program not the signal but the pathway the signal travels. |
| The brain is event-based, not clock-based | [Artificial Intelligence - Perspectives from Leading Practitioners](https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ny-2018/public/content/artificial-intelligence-teaching-machines) | This idea is in direct contrast with our current computing paradigm and advocates for a neuromorphic-based computing paradigm. The differences in processing with events instead of predefined chunks leads to massively different paradigms in how we think about computation and how it can be realized. |
| Causality and the idea of counterfactual | [The Book of Why](/books/the-book-of-why/) | Humans are unique in their ability to imagine the unreal. Counterfactuals, or the opposite of facts, deals with our ability to imagine reality as it can't be, to say that |
| System 1 (fast and intuitive) and System 2 (slow and rational) | [Thinking, Fast and Slow](/books/thinking-fast-and-slow/) / [Yoshua Bengio - From System 1 Deep Learning to System 2 Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtUbMG3rlFs) | At a high level, the brain seems to have two systems to process events in the world. These two systems arise from different brain regions and is especially important for how we manage day-to-day events. We shouldn't expect to build this into an AGI but rather the system should exhibit system-1-and-2 properties. |
| Development of intelligence through evolution (phylogeny) | [Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience](/textbooks/developmental-cognitive-neuroscience-an-introduction/) | Billions of years of evolution has shown us that intelligence is a rare and difficult trait for an organism to develop. This is further emphasized by the difficulty of finding life on other planets as life seems to prerequisite intelligence. Only through an iterative approach has evolution forged us. This suggests that if we develop AI in an interative approach, we should expect to move from simpler, older, organisms to us. Evolution provides a measure of progress for AI. |
| Development of intelligence through maturation (ontogeny) | [Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience](/textbooks/developmental-cognitive-neuroscience-an-introduction/) | Similar to the point above, our maturation provides a measure of progress for AI. If we develop an AI using the approach stated by Alan Turing, we should expect a similar developmental pathway. |
| Learning, recall and memory | [Make It Stick](/books/make-it-stick/) | Learning and memory are intimately linked and learning depends on memory. The result of learning is a memory. Recall and retrieval is the link between learning and memory as learning is the process of retrieving memories. Evidence in the form of patient H.M. shows that a deficit in memory impacts learning. |
| Adaptation | No source | The brain developed in many different organisms, ranging from dinosaurs, fruit flies, and humans. This suggests that the brain is generalizable to different environments and times. Another important, but underlooked feature, is that the brain can handle modern times. We didn't evolve with chess, driving, typing, and digital screens and yet our brain can handle it all. The brain hasn't changed in the last tens of thousands of years so it's remarkable that the brain has adapted to whatever time it's in. |
| Superintelligence may result from improvements in humans | [Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies) | I've been so focused on imbuing machines with intelligence that I forget that we can make ourselves more intelligent through genetic engineering, more brains thus higher collective intelligence, drugs, and improved education. We must remember that the goal is a greater intelligence, not creating machines with greater intelligence. |
| Embodiment and the idea that the brain evolved to guide action | [The Wiley Handbook of Evolutionary Neuroscience](/textbooks/the-wiley-handbook-of-evolutionary-neuroscience) | An AGI system must have some way of influencing the world. This means to build some input and output system for AGI such as allowing it to take in byte data and output byte data, or to create cameras for AGI and robotic bodies for it to manipulate the world. |
| Speed, volume, noise, and energy are the four basic constraints on the design of neural circuits | [The Wiley Handbook of Evolutionary Neuroscience](/textbooks/the-wiley-handbook-of-evolutionary-neuroscience) | These four limiting factors affect the creation of neuromorphic chips for AGI and also influence our hardware design of AGI. |
| Social learning and collective intelligence | [The Wiley Handbook of Evolutionary Neuroscience](/textbooks/the-wiley-handbook-of-evolutionary-neuroscience) and [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/agi/comments/i2jivi/general_intelligence/) | More evidence and thinking leads us to believe that AGI won't appear from a single smart device but rather from a collection of devices acting together. Humans have exceptionally high-fidelity copying which allows us to pass on and cumulatively collect a massive knowledge base for current humans to build off of. Our culture has played a massive role in bootstrapping our development and the role of teaching has often been overlooked in AGI. |
