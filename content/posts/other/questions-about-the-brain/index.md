The following is a list of question about the brain that I don't know the answer to. I hopeful to someday answer every question on this list.

## Unsolved Questions

- In speech, how do we separate words given there are no obvious signals (such as a pause)?
- Why do some people move their hands while speaking?
- Why does time slow down and speed up?
    - E.g. During adrenaline-heavy events, time slows down.
- What's the link between psychology ideas and the brain?
    - E.g. Intersubjective reality, conservative vs liberal, stress, sexual behaviors, learning.
- Why do some senses not/rarely show up in dreams?
    - E.g. Smell and touch.
- Where does an efference copy come from? What's the neural mechanism?
- Why is the neocortex structured the way that it is?
- What's the purpose of dreams?
- Do older memories take longer to access?
    - They certainly take longer to encode, but to access?
    - Think spatial and temporal locality from computer architecture
- Why are most dreams forgotten so quickly?
- What's the brain of a mantis shrimp like?
    - Given it's superior eyes, what's its visual cortex like?
- Does the brain actually use temporal/spatial summation for computation or is it just a byproduct of spike collisions?
- What's the difference between a signal and information?
    - This is important in understanding the brain because APs are signals, but that doesn't mean they carry information.
- After a signal is finished being processed in the brain, where does it go? When I see an object and follow the path of APs, where does it stop?
- What's the purpose of the brain ventricle? What's the wiring diagram for the neocortex?
- What is neuroscience trying to achieve? What does a complete understanding of the brain mean?
- What role did having white scleras play in social interactions?
    - Hypothesis is eye gaze.
- Is the meaning of a neural signal determined by the pathway it travels? Or is it due to the source/destination?

## Solved Questions

- Is the brain a computer?
    - No, the brain isn't an implementation of a Turing machine.
