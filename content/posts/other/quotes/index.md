## Science

- We must know, we will know. - **David Hilbert**
- A scientist builds in order to learn; an engineer learns in order to build. - **Fred Brooks**
- Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.
- I mean, you could claim that anything's real if the only basis for believing in it is that nobody's proved it doesn't exist!
- For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable – what then?
- If a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but if he will be content to begin with doubts, he shall end in certainties.
- If our brains were simple enough for us to understand them, we'd be so simple that we couldn't.
- If someone doesn't value evidence, what evidence are you going to provide to prove that they should value it? If someone doesn’t value logic, what logical argument could you provide to show the importance of logic?
- Not everything in science that is formally equivalent is semantically equivalent.
- Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. - **Carl Sagan**
- As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain, as far as they are certain they do not refer to reality. - **Albert Einstein**

- The time dilation effect seems to have been made so that people are able to travel to the stars.
- Computer science actually began with its 'theory of everything'.
- When you are famous it is hard to work on small problems. This is what did Shannon in. After information theory, what do you do for an encore? The great scientists often make this error. They fail to continue to plant the little acorns from which the mighty oak trees grow. They try to get the big thing right off. And that isn't the way things go. So that is another reason why you find that when you get early recognition it seems to sterilize you. - **Richard Hamming**
- What we know is a drop, what we don't know is an ocean. - **Issac Newton**

- And part of the reason you are able to contribute so significantly to this project is that you are not burdened by unnecessary knowledge. Some of it might help you, I agree, but some of it would also narrow your options, steer your thoughts in one particular direction, prevent you from seeing all there is to see. Since I cannot know which information would hinder your thought processes, I find it best to provide you only with what you really need to know. - **Sylvain Neuvel, Sleeping Giants**
- To steal ideas from one person is plagiarism. To steal from many is research. - **Wilson Mizner**
- Even though most of us cannot separate science from superstition or technology from magic. - **Peter Thiel**
- The drug of discovery.

### Neuroscience

- Praised be the human mind, which sees more sharply than does the human eye. - **Aaron Bernstein**
- Intelligence attributes to itself as to why we are the dominant species of this planet.
- If our brains were simple enough for us to understand them, we'd be so simple that we couldn't.
- We have not yet learned what the brain has to teach us. - **Chris Eliasmith**
- Memory is the breaking and storing bits of passing time.
- It's a poor sort of memory that only works backward.
- If there's one thing I remember about memory, it's that it doesn't do its job.
- However, you owe these drugs back what they delivered to you.
- Being funny requires a considerable amount of intelligence. It doesn't require massive amounts of intelligence but it requires enough to be able to be creative, witty, think quick, read people, play off people, ect. I've never met a dumb funny person.
- We don't live in a world of reality but in a world of perceptions.
- Of the entire range of the electromagnetic spectrum, the unaided human eye could see little more than one percent: a single octave of radiation out of an immense long keyboard of tones.
- The brain is the last and grandest biological frontier, the most complex thing we have yet discovered in our universe. It contains hundreds of billions of cells interlinked through trillions of connections. The brain boggles the mind. - **James Watson**
- Change the eyes that look at the world, change the me does the looking? - **Peter Watts, Firefall**
- [Direct stimulation of the visual cortex to induce hallucinations] That's how you can tell it wasn't. Since you don't actually see it, there's no messy eyeball optics to limit resolution. - **Peter Watts, Firefall**
- Neurons only speak when spoken to; they don’t know why. - **Peter Watts, Firefall**
- There is no red or green," said Teller. "All the colors we see are artificial; they're constructs of the mind. This beautiful rainbow of colors you see here on these felt-pens is, in reality, different shades of gray. - **Peter Cawdron, Anomaly**
- There are birds that migrate by the stars, bats that echolocate, bees that compute the variance of flower patches, spiders that spin webs, humans that speak, ants that farm, lions that hunt in teams, cheetahs that hunt alone, monogamous gibbons, polyandrous seahorses, polygynous gorillas. There are millions of animal species on earth, each with a different set of cognitive programs. The same basic neural tissue embodies all of these programs, and it could support many others as well. Facts about the properties of neurons, neurotransmitters, and cellular development cannot tell you which of these millions of programs the human mind contains. Even if all neural activity is the expression of a uniform process at the cellular level, it is the arrangement of neurons—into bird song templates or web-spinning programs—that matters. - **Steven Pinker, How the Mind Works**
- To explain how birds fly, we invoke principles of lift and drag and fluid mechanics that also explain how airplanes fly. That does not commit us to an Airplane Metaphor for birds, complete with jet engines and complimentary beverage service. - **Steven Pinker, How the Mind Works**

### Artificial Intelligence

- A year spent in artificial intelligence is enough to make one believe in God. - **Alan Perlis**
- Artificial intelligence is basically willy nilly, stabbing in the dark, trying to model natural intelligence.
- Artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity.
- Just like how there's a certain combination of DNA (ATCG) that made us, there must be a certain combination of 0s and 1s that make AI.
- Solve intelligence and then use it to help society solve everything else.
- The field was founded on the claim that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it."
- Any A.I. smart enough to pass a Turing test is smart enough to know to fail it.
- The robots declared us "artificially intelligent".
- To erase the line between man and machine is to obscure the line between men and gods. - **Ex Machina**
- To build a machine smarter than you, it has to be more complex than you—and the ability to understand the machine begins to slip away. - **David Eagleman, Sum**
- An electronic computer is also made up of matter, but organized differently; what is there so magical about the workings of the huge, slow cells of the animal brain that they can claim themselves to be conscious, but would deny a quicker, more finely-grained device of equivalent power - or even a machine hobbled so that it worked with precisely the same ponderous-ness - a similar distinction? - **Iain M. Banks, Use of Weapons**
- They [superintelligent AI] are rarely malicious, never vicious; not to us. Mainly this is because we are so far beneath them it would be demeaning to get that worked up about us and our feelings, but the thing is, they are vastly powerful artefacts, with senses and abilities and strengths that we only fool ourselves we know about or understand, and the subtlest, most infinitesimal of their machinations can bruise us, crush us utterly, if it catches us wrong. - **Iain M. Banks, The Hydrogen Sonata**
- But in all cases communication is about projecting information. Man is the only animal that uses an intermediary form for communication, something static that forms a kind of intellectual echo, whether that's a book or text on a computer screen, art hanging in a gallery or a play shown on the television, the principle is the same. The act of capturing communication, storing it and reusing it is a hallmark of intelligence, and I think they'll appreciate that. - **Peter Cawdron, Anomaly**
- Senkovi’s personal theory was that the pressure of being in the middle of the food chain was an essential prerequisite for complex intelligence. Like humans (and like Portiid spiders, had he only known), octopuses had developed in a world where they were both hunter and hunted. Top predators, in Senkovi’s assessment, were an intellectual dead end. - **Adrian Tchaikovsky, Children of Ruin**
- I wonder, briefly, if I’m going to have to go in there. And it occurs to me that until someone licks AI, this is why NASA needs monkeys in space. To make stupid monkey decisions like these. - **Hugh Howey, Beacon 23**

## Dreams

- We’re still pioneers, we’ve barely begun. Our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us, cause our destiny lies above us. - **Cooper, Interstellar**
- We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars, now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt. - **Cooper, Interstellar**
- A ship in port is safe, but that is not what ships are built for. - **John A. Shedd, Salt from My Attic**

- Don't you find it odd that when you're a kid, everyone, all the world, encourages you to follow your dreams. But when you're older, somehow they act offended if you even try. - **Ethan Hawke**
- To look up and wonder at our place in the universe, to look down and wonder my place in humanity.
- You know that place between asleep and awake, that place where you still remember dreaming? That’s where I’ll always love you. That’s where I’ll be waiting. - **Rich Edwards, Where I'll Be Waiting**

- We are always living in tomorrow’s history.
- A dream we dream together is reality. - **Burning Man 2017**
- Hope is like a road in the country; there was never a road, but when many people walk on it, the road comes into existence. - **Lu Xun**

- You don’t have to be the man you were five minutes ago.
- No, it’s impossible. It’s impossible to tell anyone what it feels like to be you. It’s impossible. We live the same way that we dream - alone. - **Joseph Conrad**
- A man must suffer if he is to remake himself, for he is both the marble and the sculptor.
- Have the courage to live a life true to yourself, not the life others expect of you.

- Think about yourself first. You’re no good to others if you aren’t good to yourself.
- They're not looking for a story that tells them who they are. They already know who they are. They're here because they want a glimpse of who they could be. - **Ford, Westworld**
- You were comforted by your future self. - **Kubera**
- Be the change that you wish to see in the world. - **Mahatma Gandhi**

- There's a big war going on in that novel, and various individuals and groups manage to influence its outcome. But even being able to do that doesn't ultimately change things very much. At the book's end, I have a section pointing this out by telling what happened after the war, which was an attempt to pose the question, 'What was it all for?' I guess this approach has to do with my reacting to the cliché of SF's 'lone protagonist.' You know, this idea that a single individual can determine the direction of entire civilizations. It's very, very hard for a lone person to do that. And it sets you thinking what difference, if any, it would have made if Jesus Christ, or Karl Marx or Charles Darwin had never been.

- A man was defined not by his flaws, but by how he overcame them. - **Brandon Sanderson, The Well of Ascension**
- Vin stepped back into the room wearing a memory. - **Brandon Sanderson, The Well of Ascension**
- Kelsier always wanted me to be a general—I think, deep down, he thought that befriending people was inferior to leading them. - **Brandon Sanderson, The Well of Ascension**
- They became servants, lest they end up as slaves. - **Brandon Sanderson, The Hero of Ages**
- You hate change. I hate it too. But things can't stay the same—and that's well, for when nothing changes in your life, it's as good as being dead. - **Brandon Sanderson, The Hero of Ages**
- A man can take it off, Lady Marasi. But he can never stop wearing it. - **Brandon Sanderson, The Alloy of Law**

- In every field, the real experts are also the best at business. - **Stefan Zweig, Chess Story**
- The transformation was total: I had created an internal projection of the chessboard and pieces and was able to see any position based on nothing more than the formulas in the book, the way an expert musician has only to glance at a score to hear all the voices and their harmonization. - **Stefan Zweig, Chess Story**
