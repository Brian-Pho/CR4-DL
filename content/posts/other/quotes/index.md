## Culture

- This book is dedicated to anyone who has ever fallen in love with a culture that was devouring their own. - **Arkady Martine, A Memory Called Empire**
- A region touched by the reaching hand of Teixcalaan but not yet subject to the weight of it. - **Arkady Martine, A Memory Called Empire**
- They were wrong, but they did not discover this until the dawn of interstellar society. Then, expeditions started finding evidence of fallen cultures, ruined worlds, extinct species. There were an uncomfortably large number of them. - **Alastair Reynolds, Redemption Ark**

## Science

- We must know, we will know. - **David Hilbert**
- A scientist builds in order to learn; an engineer learns in order to build. - **Fred Brooks**
- Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.
- I mean, you could claim that anything's real if the only basis for believing in it is that nobody's proved it doesn't exist!
- For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable – what then?
- If a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but if he will be content to begin with doubts, he shall end in certainties.
- If our brains were simple enough for us to understand them, we'd be so simple that we couldn't.
- If someone doesn't value evidence, what evidence are you going to provide to prove that they should value it? If someone doesn’t value logic, what logical argument could you provide to show the importance of logic?
- Not everything in science that is formally equivalent is semantically equivalent.
- Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. - **Carl Sagan**
- As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain, as far as they are certain they do not refer to reality. - **Albert Einstein**
- The very lack of evidence is thus treated as evidence; the absence of smoke proves that the fire is very carefully hidden. - **C. S. Lewis**
- Engineering will build the tools to test science, and science will invent the theories to guide the construction of tools.
- Explores formal principles of software engineering based on the common recognition that software engineering is not constrained by any physical laws as we know. - **Yingxu Wang, ENSF 604**
- Interesting to think of physics as a set of compression algorithms for the universe. That's basically what formulas are. - **Elon Musk**
- You can prove anything you want by coldly logical reason, if you pick the proper postulates. - **Isaac Asimov**
- Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. - **Arthur C. Clarke**
- The best way to predict the future is to invent it.
- The time dilation effect seems to have been made so that people are able to travel to the stars.
- Computer science actually began with its 'theory of everything'.
- When you are famous it is hard to work on small problems. This is what did Shannon in. After information theory, what do you do for an encore? The great scientists often make this error. They fail to continue to plant the little acorns from which the mighty oak trees grow. They try to get the big thing right off. And that isn't the way things go. So that is another reason why you find that when you get early recognition it seems to sterilize you. - **Richard Hamming**
- What we know is a drop, what we don't know is an ocean. - **Issac Newton**
- You know how powerful science can be. A thousand years to climb from ghosts and magic to technology; a day and a half from technology back up to ghosts and magic. - **Peter Watts, Firefall**
- Could we do this? Portia echoes the past question from Zaine and, to herself, admits that they could not. And yet we have come to them, not they to us. Always better to be the explorer than the explored. - **Adrian Tchaikovsky, Children of Ruin**
- She understands, in a real and immediate way, how she stands on the backs of giants, and that her own back, too, will be strong enough to bear the weight of many generations to come. - **Adrian Tchaikovsky, Children of Time**
- And part of the reason you are able to contribute so significantly to this project is that you are not burdened by unnecessary knowledge. Some of it might help you, I agree, but some of it would also narrow your options, steer your thoughts in one particular direction, prevent you from seeing all there is to see. Since I cannot know which information would hinder your thought processes, I find it best to provide you only with what you really need to know. - **Sylvain Neuvel, Sleeping Giants**
- To steal ideas from one person is plagiarism. To steal from many is research. - **Wilson Mizner**
- Even though most of us cannot separate science from superstition or technology from magic. - **Peter Thiel**
- The drug of discovery.
- I strongly believe that the only way to encourage innovation is to give it to the young. The young have a great advantage in that they are ignorant. Because I think ignorance in science is very important. If you’re like me and you know too much you can’t try new things. I always work in fields of which I’m totally ignorant. - **Sydney Brenner**
- They’re playing the science game, not doing science. - **Erik Hoel, The Revelations**
- Just like how new laws of physics were needed once you started looking at the very small and the very large, new laws might be needed once you start looking at the very complex. - **Erik Hoel, The Revelations**
- I want to believe there is more to this world than we know. - **Erik Hoel, The Revelations**
- How was science not just better eyes for seeing more of the spectrum, or smaller fingers for manipulating more accurately, sonic amplifiers for greater hearing, logic an extension of our primitive reasoning abilities, statistics to pick up on correlations in nature better than we naturally could, and so on—just tools to supplement our bodies so we could survive a bit better, a bit longer. - **Erik Hoel, The Revelations**
- Diane had grabbed faith, Jason had grabbed science. And I had grabbed Jason and Diane. - **Robert Charles Wilson, Spin**
- This is the most sophisticated technological artifact the Five Republics have produced, Tyler. - **Robert Charles Wilson, Spin**
- The star was brighter than all the others in the sky, but it still looked like a star rather than a sun. - **Alastair Reynolds, Redemption Ark**

### Neuroscience

- Praised be the human mind, which sees more sharply than does the human eye. - **Aaron Bernstein**
- Intelligence attributes to itself as to why we are the dominant species of this planet.
- If our brains were simple enough for us to understand them, we'd be so simple that we couldn't.
- We have not yet learned what the brain has to teach us. - **Chris Eliasmith**
- Memory is the breaking and storing bits of passing time.
- It's a poor sort of memory that only works backward.
- If there's one thing I remember about memory, it's that it doesn't do its job.
- However, you owe these drugs back what they delivered to you.
- Being funny requires a considerable amount of intelligence. It doesn't require massive amounts of intelligence but it requires enough to be able to be creative, witty, think quick, read people, play off people, ect. I've never met a dumb funny person.
- We don't live in a world of reality but in a world of perceptions.
- Of the entire range of the electromagnetic spectrum, the unaided human eye could see little more than one percent: a single octave of radiation out of an immense long keyboard of tones.
- The brain is the last and grandest biological frontier, the most complex thing we have yet discovered in our universe. It contains hundreds of billions of cells interlinked through trillions of connections. The brain boggles the mind. - **James Watson**
- Change the eyes that look at the world, change the me does the looking? - **Peter Watts, Firefall**
- [Direct stimulation of the visual cortex to induce hallucinations] That's how you can tell it wasn't. Since you don't actually see it, there's no messy eyeball optics to limit resolution. - **Peter Watts, Firefall**
- Neurons only speak when spoken to; they don’t know why. - **Peter Watts, Firefall**
- There is no red or green. All the colors we see are artificial; they're constructs of the mind. This beautiful rainbow of colors you see here on these felt-pens is, in reality, different shades of gray. - **Peter Cawdron, Anomaly**
- There are birds that migrate by the stars, bats that echolocate, bees that compute the variance of flower patches, spiders that spin webs, humans that speak, ants that farm, lions that hunt in teams, cheetahs that hunt alone, monogamous gibbons, polyandrous seahorses, polygynous gorillas. There are millions of animal species on earth, each with a different set of cognitive programs. The same basic neural tissue embodies all of these programs, and it could support many others as well. Facts about the properties of neurons, neurotransmitters, and cellular development cannot tell you which of these millions of programs the human mind contains. Even if all neural activity is the expression of a uniform process at the cellular level, it is the arrangement of neurons—into bird song templates or web-spinning programs—that matters. - **Steven Pinker, How the Mind Works**
- To explain how birds fly, we invoke principles of lift and drag and fluid mechanics that also explain how airplanes fly. That does not commit us to an Airplane Metaphor for birds, complete with jet engines and complimentary beverage service. - **Steven Pinker, How the Mind Works**
- But then we always suspected the cortex is a mere blanket for regulating the temperature of the crucial parts of the brain. And while some continue to protest that “the folds of human cortex are what makes us unique!”, they are denying the simple, near universally-accepted explanation — greater surface area improves heat dissipation. - **Mark Humphries, Review of 2019 in neuroscience**
- Cogito ergo sum ('I think, therefore I am') - **Descartes**
- The brain is a world consisting of a number of unexplored continents and great stretches of unknown territory. - **Santiago Ramon y Cajal**
- The initial cause of any human action lies outside the person. - **Ivan Mikhailovich Sechenov**
- Instead of promising to satisfy your curiosity in what concerns the anatomy of the brain, I do confess here sincerely and publicly that I know nothing of this matter. - **Matthew Cobb, The Idea of the Brain**
- Long before art and science and philosophy arose, consciousness had but one function: not to merely implement motor commands, but to mediate between commands in opposition. - **Peter Watts, Firefall**
- There is something it is like to be! - **Erik Hoel, The Revelations**
- What a mighty thing, consciousness! What aspect of our world does it not touch? In science it shows itself across all hierarchies, all primary and all special sciences. It appears as the monarch of psychology with all other mental events its yoked subjects. - **Erik Hoel, The Revelations**
- It is unlike, in kind, anything else in nature. It has a greater claim to existence than anything else. Consciousness is not the hypothesis. The outside world is the hypothesis. If you cannot accommodate consciousness in your natural order, then the natural order must expand. - **Erik Hoel, The Revelations**
- Reading neuroscience textbooks had always given Kierk that creepy feeling of being a machine reading its own blueprints. - **Erik Hoel, The Revelations**
- The current neuroscientific explanation for the effect is that memories are laid down in greater detail and in greater number during novel experiences, so it really just seems as if subjective time slows. But to Kierk this can’t be the entire explanation; rather, it has to be that each conscious moment is actually deeper, richer—there is a greater volume of consciousness. - **Erik Hoel, The Revelations**
- In which case the amount of time experienced is a function of the richness of the experience. - **Erik Hoel, The Revelations**
- The brain, restored and rewired, became a subtly different organ. And its owner became a subtly different human being. - **Robert Charles Wilson, Spin**
- It was like a picture of an impossible solid, one of those warped triangles or ever-rising staircases; a thing that looked plausible enough at first glance but which on closer inspection produced the effect of a knife twisting in a particular part of the brain—an area responsible for handling representations of the external universe, ah area that handled the mechanics of what did and didn’t work. - **Alastair Reynolds, Absolution Gap**
- 'Memory, Khouri. Memory being laid down instantaneously. The dream felt real, but it was created in an instant when the dog began licking your face. Back-constructed. You never actually lived through it. It's the same with these memories.' - **Alastair Reynolds, Revelation Space**
- The complexity of the human brain, in its construction and function, has limited our ability to understand it. - **Yasemin Saplakoglu**

### Artificial Intelligence

- A year spent in artificial intelligence is enough to make one believe in God. - **Alan Perlis**
- Artificial intelligence is basically willy nilly, stabbing in the dark, trying to model natural intelligence.
- Artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity.
- Just like how there's a certain combination of DNA (ATCG) that made us, there must be a certain combination of 0s and 1s that make AI.
- Solve intelligence and then use it to help society solve everything else.
- The field was founded on the claim that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it."
- Any A.I. smart enough to pass a Turing test is smart enough to know to fail it.
- The robots declared us "artificially intelligent".
- To erase the line between man and machine is to obscure the line between men and gods. - **Ex Machina**
- To build a machine smarter than you, it has to be more complex than you—and the ability to understand the machine begins to slip away. - **David Eagleman, Sum**
- An electronic computer is also made up of matter, but organized differently; what is there so magical about the workings of the huge, slow cells of the animal brain that they can claim themselves to be conscious, but would deny a quicker, more finely-grained device of equivalent power - or even a machine hobbled so that it worked with precisely the same ponderous-ness - a similar distinction? - **Iain M. Banks, Use of Weapons**
- They [superintelligent AI] are rarely malicious, never vicious; not to us. Mainly this is because we are so far beneath them it would be demeaning to get that worked up about us and our feelings, but the thing is, they are vastly powerful artefacts, with senses and abilities and strengths that we only fool ourselves we know about or understand, and the subtlest, most infinitesimal of their machinations can bruise us, crush us utterly, if it catches us wrong. - **Iain M. Banks, The Hydrogen Sonata**
- But in all cases communication is about projecting information. Man is the only animal that uses an intermediary form for communication, something static that forms a kind of intellectual echo, whether that's a book or text on a computer screen, art hanging in a gallery or a play shown on the television, the principle is the same. The act of capturing communication, storing it and reusing it is a hallmark of intelligence, and I think they'll appreciate that. - **Peter Cawdron, Anomaly**
- Senkovi’s personal theory was that the pressure of being in the middle of the food chain was an essential prerequisite for complex intelligence. Like humans (and like Portiid spiders, had he only known), octopuses had developed in a world where they were both hunter and hunted. Top predators, in Senkovi’s assessment, were an intellectual dead end. - **Adrian Tchaikovsky, Children of Ruin**
- I wonder, briefly, if I’m going to have to go in there. And it occurs to me that until someone licks AI, this is why NASA needs monkeys in space. To make stupid monkey decisions like these. - **Hugh Howey, Beacon 23**
- They had never encountered another extant machine-using intelligence, nothing to measure themselves against. Until now. - **Alastair Reynolds, Redemption Ark**

## Dreams

- We’re still pioneers, we’ve barely begun. Our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us, cause our destiny lies above us. - **Cooper, Interstellar**
- We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars, now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt. - **Cooper, Interstellar**
- A ship in port is safe, but that is not what ships are built for. - **John A. Shedd, Salt from My Attic**

- I had wanted to make history move ahead in the same way that a child pulls on a plant to make it grow more quickly. - **Václav Havel**
- Don't you find it odd that when you're a kid, everyone, all the world, encourages you to follow your dreams. But when you're older, somehow they act offended if you even try. - **Ethan Hawke**
- To look up and wonder at our place in the universe, to look down and wonder my place in humanity.
- You know that place between asleep and awake, that place where you still remember dreaming? That’s where I’ll always love you. That’s where I’ll be waiting. - **Rich Edwards, Where I'll Be Waiting**
- They pop up every now and then. People who don't wake up from the dream even after tens of years. I love people like that. - **Erika Yano, Shirobako**
- We are always living in tomorrow’s history.
- A dream we dream together is reality. - **Burning Man 2017**
- Hope is like a road in the country; there was never a road, but when many people walk on it, the road comes into existence. - **Lu Xun**
- One day you will wake up and there won’t be any more time to do the things you’ve always wanted. Do it now. - **Paulo Coelho**
- Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for. - **Epicurus**
- Words like anchors, tethering boats of memory that would otherwise be scuttled by the storm. - **Robert Charles Wilson, Spin**

## Identity

- Not all those who wander are lost. - **J.R.R. Tolkien, The Fellowship of the Ring**
- Perhaps it's impossible to wear an identity without becoming what you pretend to be.
- We judge others by their actions and ourselves on our intentions.
- We’d care a lot less about what others thought about us, if we realized how little they did.
- You're the asshole. Not because you're wrong, but because you were a dick about it.
- You can let people walk all over you and they will still complain that you are not lying flat enough.
- People won't remember the words you say but how it made them feel.
- Normal people are just people you don't know very well.
- It’s not your fault but it is your responsibility.
- He who knows the "why" for his existence will be able to bear almost any "how".
- I’m mystified by how people can talk all day and yet say absolutely nothing. - **Reddit**
- Don't let me do everything I want because sometimes I make bad choices. - **Reddit**
- You don’t have to be the man you were five minutes ago.
- No, it’s impossible. It’s impossible to tell anyone what it feels like to be you. It’s impossible. We live the same way that we dream - alone. - **Joseph Conrad**
- A man must suffer if he is to remake himself, for he is both the marble and the sculptor.
- Have the courage to live a life true to yourself, not the life others expect of you.
- There are days that define your story beyond your life. - **Louise Banks, Arrival**
- Think about yourself first. You’re no good to others if you aren’t good to yourself.
- They're not looking for a story that tells them who they are. They already know who they are. They're here because they want a glimpse of who they could be. - **Ford, Westworld**
- You were comforted by your future self. - **Kubera**
- Be the change that you wish to see in the world. - **Mahatma Gandhi**
- The world is changed by your example, not by your opinion. - **Paulo Coelho**

- Don't make this hard on me, I'm already hard on myself. - **TELYKast, Somebody Else**
- When you're 20 you care what everyone thinks, when you're 40 you stop caring what everyone thinks, when you're 60 you realize no one was ever thinking about you in the first place. - **Reddit**
- Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. - **James Clear**
- Never make fun of someone for things they can't change.
- You do not follow me because I am the strongest. Pax is. You do not follow me because I am the brightest. Mustang is. You follow me because you do not know where you are going. I do. - **Darrow, Red Rising**

- These mountains that you are carrying, you were only supposed to climb. - **Najwa Zebian**
- Each time you do something generous, you’re shaping yourself into someone who’s more likely to be generous next time, and that matters. - **Ted Chiang, Exhalation**
- They're artists of information, and each data point adds a bit more pigment to their accumulating portrait of you. - **David Eagleman, Sum**
- The knowledge that you cannot appreciate the destination without knowing the starting point. - **David Eagleman, Sum**
- There's a big war going on in that novel, and various individuals and groups manage to influence its outcome. But even being able to do that doesn't ultimately change things very much. At the book's end, I have a section pointing this out by telling what happened after the war, which was an attempt to pose the question, 'What was it all for?' I guess this approach has to do with my reacting to the cliché of SF's 'lone protagonist.' You know, this idea that a single individual can determine the direction of entire civilizations. It's very, very hard for a lone person to do that. And it sets you thinking what difference, if any, it would have made if Jesus Christ, or Karl Marx or Charles Darwin had never been. We just don't know. - **Iain M. Banks, Consider Phlebas**
- We are what we do, not what we think. - **Iain M. Banks, The Player of Games**

- Go quietly, and you’re a number. Go in spectacular fashion, and you’re a name. - **Hugh Howey, Beacon 23**
- He somehow gets that I’m fucked up but that it isn’t my fault, and this feels really fucking amazing, to have someone think it’s not all my fault, and so I cry and cry while little pebbles and bits of steel bounce off my beacon and go tumbling like shed tears out into the cosmos. - **Hugh Howey, Beacon 23**
- A man was defined not by his flaws, but by how he overcame them. - **Brandon Sanderson, The Well of Ascension**
- Vin stepped back into the room wearing a memory. - **Brandon Sanderson, The Well of Ascension**
- Kelsier always wanted me to be a general—I think, deep down, he thought that befriending people was inferior to leading them. - **Brandon Sanderson, The Well of Ascension**
- They became servants, lest they end up as slaves. - **Brandon Sanderson, The Hero of Ages**
- You hate change. I hate it too. But things can't stay the same—and that's well, for when nothing changes in your life, it's as good as being dead. - **Brandon Sanderson, The Hero of Ages**
- A man can take it off, Lady Marasi. But he can never stop wearing it. - **Brandon Sanderson, The Alloy of Law**

- Modern life is a path that we must chart on our own. - **Logan Ury, How to Not Die Alone**
- If we’re in charge, then we have only ourselves to blame. We could fail, and then it would be our fault. - **Logan Ury, How to Not Die Alone**

## Relationships

- Great relationships are built, not discovered. - **Logan Ury, How to Not Die Alone**

### Romantic

- When you’re wearing rose-colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags.
- Do you know what time erases? Pain. Do you know what erases time? Love.
- You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams.
- The most painful thing is losing yourself in the process of loving someone too much, and forgetting that you are special too.

- We accept the love we think we deserve.
- Every human relationship can be adjusted with the right amount of money.
- Back when it was new, that distance brought you together. Now, the closeness pulls you apart.
- Don't make permanent decisions based on temporary feelings.
- Everybody is looking for the right person, and nobody is trying to be the right person.
- When a person tells you that you hurt them, you don't get to decide that you didn't.
- But better to get hurt by the truth than comforted with a lie.
- Don't walk behind me; I may not lead. Don't walk in front of me; I may not follow. Just walk beside me and be my friend.
- Just because someone is easy to talk to does not mean that you should tell them everything.
- To the world you may be one person; but to one person you may be the world.
- If the women don't find you handsome, they should at least find you handy.
- How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard.
- Just because a relationship ends, that doesn't mean it was a failure or a mistake.
- You're not afraid she's going to say no, and you're afraid she's going to say yes. - **Reddit**
- Don't make someone a priority when all you are to them is an option.
- One day, whether you are 14, 28 or 65, you will stumble upon someone who will start a fire in you that cannot die. However, the saddest, most awful truth you will ever come to find – is they are not always with whom we spend our lives.

This is why body count matters. - **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwSu1cp4xBQ)**
- Just remember ladies, you’re the gatekeeper of sexual opportunity ... but men are the gatekeeper of marriage opportunity. As long as men set the standard for who they want to marry, your opinion on your body count doesn’t matter. Either be the woman your dream-guy wants you to be, or do whatever you want and live with what’s left.
- Many relationships exist because they figured out they can’t have the home or lifestyle they want without having a spouse.
- A lot of you confuse ghosting with them just losing interest in you.
- It’s just that what is being said isn’t “I don’t like fat people”, what is being said is “I don’t find fat people physically attractive”.
- While walking together casually say "here can you hold this for me?" and just hold out your empty hand.

- If you’re not going on dates, you’re not getting closer to knowing the kind of person you want to be with long term. - **Logan Ury, How to Not Die Alone**

### Loneliness

- A hug, all the warmth, but none of the heat. - **V.E. Schwab, Vicious**
- I lost myself trying to please everyone. Now I'm losing everyone as I find myself.
- I learned to give, not because I have too much. But because I know how it feels to have nothing.
- I think the saddest people always try their hardest to make people happy because they know what it’s like to feel absolutely worthless and they don’t want anyone else to feel like that.
- The loneliest people are the kindest, The saddest people smile the brightest. The most damaged people are the wisest. All because they do not wish to see anyone else suffer the way they do.
- In an era of breadlines, Depression, and wars, I tried to help people get away from all the misery; to turn their minds to something else. I wanted to make people happy, if only for an hour. - **Busby Berkeley**
- Let me tell you this: if you meet a loner, no matter what they tell you, it's not because they enjoy solitude. It's because they have tried to blend into the world before, and people continue to disappoint them.
- Loneliness does not come from having no people about one, but from being unable to communicate the things that seem important to oneself, or from holding certain views which others find inadmissible.
- We humans are alone in this world for a reason. We murdered and butchered anything that challenged our primacy. - **Westworld**
- When you look out and realize how lonely we are, and when you look in and realize how lonely you are.
- If one's different, one's bound to be lonely.
- The loneliest moment in someone's life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly.
- People want to be loved; failing that, admired; failing that, feared; failing that, hated and despised. They want to evoke some sort of sentiment. The soul shudders before oblivion and seeks connection at any price.
- These walls that I built to protect me are now crushing me.
- Nobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal - **Albert Camus**
- I guess that’s the strange torment I suffer: dying for company, for someone to talk to, but it’s never the right someone who shows. And an unwelcome presence is far worse than miserable silence. - **Hugh Howey, Beacon 23**

- No one compares, you stand alone. - **Selena Gomez, Love You Like a Love Song**

- But it was something along the lines of how parents raise good children but should instead be raising good adults.
- If you raise your kids you can spoil your grandchildren, but if you spoil your kids you will have to raise your grandchildren.

- Pretending that the fake is real only makes the real seem fake.

- The future seems knowable only when it becomes the past.
- If you are given a choice, you believe you have acted freely. - **Raymond Teller**
