### How the Mind Works

*Rating: 2/5*

A disappointment. The book has no overarching theory but is rather a collection of the author's thoughts. While interesting, the are disjointed and leaves the reader asking "so what?"

### The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat

*Rating: 3/5*

A dated but ok book on neurological diseases. Some cases are interesting but the majority aren't. The stories, while about people, lack humanity and emotion.

### Range

*Rating: 2/5*

A disappointment of a book. It was just a collection of stories that had no overarching theme. It starts out interesting but ends without a satisfying smoking-gun conclusion.

### The Secret of Our Success

*Rating: 4/5*

A great but long read. The author argues that culture is the secret of our success and delves into this argument with examples and hypotheses. I felt the book to be longer than necessary and there was a lot of repetition of ideas.

### The Brain From Inside Out

*Rating: 1/5*

This book started off great but was in the end a let down. It starts with grand visions and claims but the second half falls short of providing an alternative solution. Read more like a criticism of others than presenting the author's own ideas.

### Your Brain Is a Time Machine

*Rating: 3/5*

The average neuroscience book. It was interesting and split time into it's physical and biological perspectives which is good.

### The Spike

*Rating: 4/5*

One of the first times someone decides to follow the electrical spike from sensory organ to brain. While it does fall short at the end, it isn't necessarily the author's fault since neuroscience has yet to catch up.

### So You Want to Be a Neuroscientist?

*Rating: 5/5*

A great and concise book on the path to becoming a neuroscientist. The author is aware that academia isn't the right path for all and provides a look into other paths.

### Life Lessons from a Brain Surgeon

*Rating: 2/5*

More of a self-help book than about the brain. While there are some interesting facts, such as a live brain is actually pink not gray, this just goes to show that people with experience may not be able to convey their experience.

### The Idea of the Brain

*Rating: 5/5*

An incredible book on the history of the brain. The author starts with how we even figured out that it was the brain, and not the heart, that's the seat of everything we're aware of.

### In Search of Memory

*Rating: 2/5*

Eric Kandel's autobiography. It's ok.

### Livewired

*Rating: 5/5*

An unexpected great book. It deals with neuroplasticity and it's many forms from sensory replacement and substitution to sensory enhancement.

### On Writing Well

*Rating: 2/5*

The start is great but the rest of the book is dated. The main takeaway is that writing is mostly rewriting.

### Thinking in Systems

*Rating: 5/5*

A book on how to think about systems, what goes in, what goes out, and what stays behind.

### Nonviolent Communication

*Rating: 5/5*

A neglected topic that's extremely important for communicating with others. The book has great steps and examples along the way to nonviolent communication.

### The Book of Why

*Rating: 3/5*

A decent book on the science of causality. However, it felt more like the author was shitting on others, specifically the machine learning community, than on pushing and developing their own idea.

### Catching Fire

*Rating: 4/5*

A concise book on how cooking was a keystone development in our evolution.

### The Feeling of What Happens

*Rating: 3/5*

An ok book presenting a theory of consciousness. While some of the ideas are great, like how the brainstem has our core consciousness and the cerebral cortex has our extended consciousness, the book was too philosophical at times.

### Connectome

*Rating: 4/5*

A good book on how the wiring of the brain matters. It's well structured by presenting the ideas to a general audience and builds up an understanding of the problem.

### The Human Advantage

*Rating: 5/5*

A great book on how the most extraordinary piece of our biology is the number of neurons in our cerebral cortex. I loved how the author mixed the science with stories such as the stories behind the experiments.

### Where Good Ideas Come From

*Rating: 5/5*

An amazing book analyzing common factors of good ideas.

### Atomic Habits

*Rating: 4/5*

A decent book on creating and following habits.

### 57 Ways to Screw Up Grad School

*Rating: 3/5*

An ok book on graduate school. Not all apply but it's useful to know.

### Thinking, Fast and Slow

*Rating: 3/5*

A so-so book on what the author proposes as two forms of thinking. It does well in combining the author's personal story with the science but falls short in that it gets too technical at times.

### Peak

*Rating: 5/5*

Another great book that opened my eyes to the world of masters and the training required to become one. The claims are well established by experiments and there's an overall theory/argument in the book.

### The Power of Meaning

*Rating: 4/5*

A somewhat spiritual book on how to live a meaningful life. Life is more than happiness.

### Make It Stick

*Rating: 5/5*

A great book on how to learn to learn. The arguments are grounded in evidence and the examples fit overall theory that the best way to learn is distributed retrieval practice.

### Unlimited Memory (Incomplete)

*Rating: 1/5*

An ok book.

### Mastery

*Rating: 5/5*

One of the best books I've read. The book is well structured and written with arguments and examples. The steps to become a master are simple but not easy.

### Outliers (Incomplete)

*Rating: 2/5*

An amazing book at first but as I learned more about the research behind the author's claims it wasn't so amazing.

### Predictably Irrational

*Rating: 3/5*

A decent psychology book that deals with how we make decisions. However, the decisions and experiments mentioned in the book are biased towards monetary decisions.
