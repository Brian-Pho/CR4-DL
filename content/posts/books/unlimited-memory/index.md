# NOTE: This is an incomplete set of notes.

## General Notes

- Only if you can remember information can you live it.
- Learning is the ability to acquire new information, and memory holds the new information in place over time.
- You have to believe that you can improve your memory.
- Four Cs
    - Concentration
    - Create imagery
    - Connecting concepts
    - Continuous use
- Where your attention goes, your energy flows.
- If you believe your limits, your life will become limited.
- We need why power, not willpower.
- A belief is a sense of being certain and what you believe, you become.
- There is no failure, only feedback.
- We destroy our concentration by multitasking.
- *PIC*: Purpose, Interest, Curiosity
- Apply the same reading method we do to novels (movies in our head) to textbooks.
- Sound is limited as a memory because it doesn't attach easily to other memories and is also sequential unlike images.
- Use your senses as those are the only five ways to get anything into your brain. (we have more than 5 senses though)
- Exaggerate to engage your memory.
- Energize to give your memory life.
- The greatest secret of a powerful memory is to bring information to life with your endless imagination.
- The secret to accelerated learning is superior organization.
- People say "I know the face, but I can't remember the name" but never "The face is on the tip of my tongue".

1. Create a vision.
2. Make a decision. You will not allow for any other possibility.
3. Stop listening to your feelings.
4. Daily action.

- Remember to review to renew.
