My apologies for the lack of notes on this book. I read this years ago and I didn't take very good notes at the time.

## General Notes

### Cutoff Dates

- Date of birth and cutoff dates affect a person’s success rate.
- People with more time get the "accumulative advantage".
- Cutoff dates matter.

### Talent

- Hard work triumphs over talent.
- 10,000 hours for mastery.
- Not everyone is born equal.
- Not just based on individual merit.
- Fate versus choice.

### IQ

- IQ threshold.
- IQ doesn’t equal smartness.
- IQ as a logarithmic graph.
- Divergence and convergence test.
- ABCD versus brick and blanket.
- IQ doesn’t equal creativity.

### Culture

- Be assertive, culture affects us.
- Cultural legacies matter.
- Asian people are good at math because the language component makes it easy and the culture is hard working.

## Evolution Notes

- Organisms don’t adapt to the environment. They change randomly and by chance they get better traits suited to the environment.
- Survival of the fittest doesn’t mean the strongest organism, it means the organism best suited to it’s environment, not survival, not reproduction.
- Evolution has no purpose.
