# NOTE: This is an incomplete set of notes.

## Preface

- Metaphors and similes are wonderful literary devices but they do nothing but obscure the beauty of technology.
- The distinction between memory and storage is an artificial one and exists solely because we don’t have a single storage medium that’s both fast, vast, and nonvolatile.
- What we know today as the “von Neumann architecture”, the dominant computer architecture, is a direct result of this technical deficiency.
- Code: a system of signals used to represent letters or numbers in transmitting messages. A system of symbols given certain arbitrary meanings used for transmitting messages requiring secrecy or brevity.

## Chapter 1: Best Friends

- Can flashlights be made to speak?
- Review of Morse code where every letter of the alphabet matches a short series of dots and dashes.
- Code: a system for transferring information among people and machines.
- In other words, a code lets you communicate, sometimes in secret, but most times not.
- There seems to be no reason why cats aren’t called “dogs” and dogs aren’t called “cats.
- You could say English vocabulary is a type of code.
- A code is useful if it serves a purpose that no other code can.
- Computers can’t deal with human codes directly because computers can’t duplicate the ways in which human beings use their eyes, ears, mouths, and fingers.

## Chapter 2: Codes and Combinations

- The invention of Morse code goes hand-in-hand with the invention of the telegraph.
- Most people find it easier to send Morse code than to receive it because most Morse code tables go from alphabetical letter → Morse code dots and dashes and not the reverse.
- But it isn’t obvious how we could construct such a table.
- $$number\ of\ codes = 2^{number\ of\ symbols}$$
- To make the process of decoding Morse code even easier, we could make a treelike table.
- Undefined: a code that doesn’t stand for anything.

## Chapter 3: Braille and Binary Codes

- Review of the invention of Braille inspired by Barbier’s system.
- Precedence/shift codes: codes that alter the meaning of the codes that follow them.
- E.g. Number indicator and capital indicator.

## Chapter 4: Anatomy of a Flashlight

- Review of electrons, atoms, and molecules.
- Review of electricity, conductors, and insulators.

## Chapter 5: Seeing Around Corners

- Review of the ground/earth electrical component.

## Chapter 6: Telegraphs and Relays

- I'm dropping this book at chapter 6 because I learned most of this book in school already. This would be a great book for reviewing the material or for beginners, but not for educated electrical and software engineers.
