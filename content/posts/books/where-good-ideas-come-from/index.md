## Introduction: REEF, CITY, WEB

- The reef is a story of how Charles Darwin observed a coral reef.
- The number of heartbeats per lifetime tends to be stable from species to species. Bigger animals just take longer to use their quota so they live longer.
- *Kleiber's law*: as life gets bigger, it also gets slower.
- This isn't true for cities as they get bigger, they get more innovative.
- *10/10 Rule*: ten years to develop an idea, ten years to find mass market.
- To understand where good ideas come from, we first have to understand the context that gives rise to them.
- There are shared patterns that recur again and again to create these innovative ideas.
- Each pattern is its own chapter.
- We lack a unified theory that describes innovation systems.
- We are often better served by connecting ideas rather than protecting them.
- Good ideas want to complete each other as much as they want to compete.

## Chapter 1: THE ADJACENT POSSIBLE

- Good ideas are constrained by the parts and skills that surround them.
- Good ideas don't come cleanly from a factory, they're cobbled together from spare parts in a garage.
- Evolution does the same thing when innovating.
- E.g. The kludge of the brain.
- *Adjacent possible*: the area of possible innovations given the current area. The realm of available possibilities.
- E.g. Going from electricity to the telegram, not the Internet.
- You can't explore outside of that area and if you do, you're called ahead of your time.
- The adjacent possible boundaries grow as we explore those boundaries.
- New innovations open up more new innovations.
- Think of it like a circle that keeps expanding.
- Good ideas aren't conjured out of thin air, they're built out of what we already know.
- E.g. The paper "Are Inventions Inevitable?".
- The story of innovation is linear, with one door opening another.
- Ideas that jump pass the closed doors are often short-term failures. Right idea, wrong environment.
- E.g. Babbage's Analytical Engine.
- What kind of environment creates good ideas?
    - Ones that help people explore their adjacent possible.
    - Encouraging novel ways of using what we have.
    - To push the adjacent possible. To advance. To explore.
- The dominance of multiples in innovation highlights how the adjacent possible is constrained by existing parts and knowledge.
- Multiples: when several people independently make the same discovery almost simultaneously.
- What tactics can we use to better explore the adjacent possible?
- One tactic, the next pattern, is to have the adjacent possible expand itself.
- E.g. Recursive self-improvement.
- We must improve our ability to improve.

## Chapter 2: LIQUID NETWORKS

- There's a misconception that an idea is a single thing. It isn't, its a network.
- Its a literal network in your brain, a new connection that's never been formed before.
- The network has two preconditions
    - The sheer size of the network
    - The network must be plastic and changeable
- To push the brain towards more creative networks, you have to place it into an environment that shares the same network signature.
- Networks of ideas or people that mimic the neural networks of the mind exploring the boundaries of the adjacent possible.
- The network in the brain is similar to a liquid: flexible enough to adapt but rigid enough to preserve.
- One of the benefits of the agriculture revolution was that it brought people together to share ideas.
- High-density liquid networks make it easier for innovation to happen, but they also store those innovations.
- A network let's good ideas thrive while killing off bad ideas. The natural selection of ideas.
- However, these networks aren't the same as a hive mind or global brain.
- Large collectives aren't capable of true innovation due to herd mentality.
- Networks simply widen the pool of minds that could come up with and share good ideas.
- It isn't the wisdom of the crowd, it's the wisdom of someone in the crowd.
- People tend to condense the origin stories of their ideas into tidy narratives but that isn't the case.
- Innovation is often messy, convoluted, and full of failures.
- The most productive tool for generating good ideas is discussion with others.
- There needs to be a balance between order and chaos, between solid and gas.
- The mental state of flow is a good analogy for fluid ideas. It's being carried in a clear direction but still being tossed in surprising ways from eddies and whirls.

## Chapter 3: THE SLOW HUNCH

- A pattern that recurs throughout the history of world changing ideas: a hunch that collides with another hunch.
- Most great ideas first take shape in partial, incomplete form.
- E.g. The theory of evolution was nearly complete in Darwin's notebooks.
- Liquid networks help those ideas become complete by merging it with other hunches.
- Sustaining the slow hunch is less a matter of perspiration than of cultivation.
- Slow hunches mature slowly, in stealth and then fading into view.
- Secrets of hunch cultivation
    - Write it down because it won't last in memory.
    - A system to capture the hunches, not categorize them.
    - A space for slow hunches to grow.

## Chapter 4: SERENDIPITY

- Dreams seem to explore new truths by trying new neuron firing combinations.
- Sexual reproduction is slow and complicated, but is repaid in its rate of innovation and creativity.
- When nature finds itself in need of new ideas, it strives to connect, not protect.
- Serendipity needs unlikely collisions and discoveries, but it also needs something to anchor those discoveries.
- Potential combinations of ideas are limited by what you remember.
- If the commonplace book tells us that the best way to nurture hunches is to write everything done, then the web tells us to look everything up.
- Protecting ideas from copycats and competitors also protects them from improvements and innovations.
- The secret to organizational inspiration is to build information networks that allow hunches to persist, disperse, and recombine.

## Chapter 5: ERROR

- A lot of spectacularly right ideas have a shadow history of spectacular failures.
- The same lesson about quantity over quality.
- The errors of the great mind exceed in number those of the less vigorous one.
- Being right keeps you in place, being wrong forces you to explore.
- Error is needed to set off the truth, much as a dark background is required for exhibiting the brightness of a picture.
- Being wrong doesn't unlock new doors in the adjacent possible, but it does force us to look for them.
- They assumed the results of the experiment was noise, not signal.
- A paradoxical truth about innovative ideas: good ideas are more likely to emerge in environments that contain a certain amount of noise and error.
- Interesting, evolution has struck a balance between too much mutation and too much stability.
- The explore-and-exploit tradeoff. The risk and reward tradeoff.
- When the going gets tough, life tends to gravitate towards more innovative reproductive strategies.
- Sex keeps the door to the adjacent possible open by just a crack, so that we can adapt to the changing pressures or opportunities of our environment.
- The complicated relationship between accuracy and error, between signal and noise.
- Perhaps the history of the errors of mankind, all things considered, is more valuable and interesting than that of their discoveries. Truth is uniform and narrow; it constantly exists, and does not require so much an active energy, as a passive aptitude of soul in order to encounter it. But error is endlessly diversified.

## Chapter 6: EXAPTATION

- *Exaptation*: an organism develops a trait optimized for a single use but then the trait gets hijacked for a completely different function.
- E.g. A feature adapted for warmth, such as feathers, is now exapted for flight.
- It's using what you have in a new environment or way.
- Collisions of different fields of expertise leads to creativity.
- The value of "weak tie" networks isn't just that information is communicated across distant fields, it's that it allows for exaptation to occur.
- Chance favors the connected mind.

## Chapter 7: PLATFORMS

- The platform builders and ecosystem engineers don't just open a door in the adjacent possible. They build an entire new floor.
- Playing inside the rules versus playing with the rules.
- The real benefit of stacked platforms is that they abstract away the details.

## Conclusion: THE FOURTH QUADRANT

- When you view things at a distance, what you lose in detail you gain in perspective.
- We can organize innovations into four quadrants: individual vs network and market vs non-market.
- Because innovations are cumulative, the quadrants display distinct shapes at different historical periods.
- The pattern of growth seems to be network non-market as profit creates barriers.
- The pattern we see again and again in the modern era: network non-market innovations create a new platform for businesses to profit by refining the original idea or by building upon it.
- The reef has unlocked so many doors of the adjacent possible because of the way it shares.
