## Introduction

- Writing has gone electric, but nothing had replaced the writer.
- The purpose of the writer is to say something that the other people will want to read.
- This books complements *The Elements of Style* book by applying those principles to nonfiction works.
- The essence of writing is rewriting.
- Just because the writing is fluent doesn't mean they're writing well.

# Part I: Principles

## Chapter 1: The Transaction

- There isn't any right method for writing.
- Any method that helps you say what you want to say is the right method for you.
- The product of a writer isn't the subject they're writing about but the subject of themselves.
- Good writing has an aliveness that keeps the reader reading.

## Chapter 2: Simplicity

- The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components.
- E.g. Words with no function, long words that could be shorter, and adverbs that copy the meaning already carried by the verb.
- Simplify, simplify.
- To clear our writing of clutter, we must clear our heads of clutter.
- Clear thinking becomes clear writing.
- E.g of clutter
    - So much verbiage that the reader doesn't know what it means.
    - Shoddily constructed sentences.
    - Switching pronouns midsentence.
    - Switching tenses midsentence.
    - No logical sequence.
    - Incorrect word usage.
- Writers must constantly ask themselves
    - What am I trying to say?
    - And have I said it?
- Good writing doesn't come naturally, although most people think it does.
- Writing is hard work.

## Chapter 3: Clutter

- Clutter is the laborious phrase that has pushed out the short word to mean the same thing.
- E.g. "At this point in time" instead of "now".
- "Experiencing" is one of the worst clutter.
- E.g. "Are you experiencing pain" instead of "Does it hurt?"
- Clutter is used to sound pompous and to hide mistakes.
- Clutter is the enemy of clear writing.
- Aim to replace a long word with a short word with the same meaning.
- E.g. Replace "assistance" with "help" and "implement" with "do".
- The same goes for phrases such as "I might add" or "It is interesting to note".
- Don't inflate what needs no inflating.
- Look for the clutter in your writing and prune it ruthlessly.

## Chapter 4: Style

- You have to strip your writing down before you can build it back up.
- When you try to add style into your writing, it loses what makes you unique.
- A fundamental rule is to be yourself.
- Write in the first person and use "I" and "me" and "we" and "us".
- If you aren't allowed to use "I", at least think "I" while you write.
- Writing is an ego, and you might as well admit it.

## Chapter 5: The Audience

- Who am I writing for?
- You are writing for yourself. There is no great mass audience.
- Never say anything in writing that you wouldn't comfortably say in conversation.

## Chapter 6: Words

- Develop a respect for words and a curiosity about their shades of meaning.
- Take the time to find the words you want.
- Don't use cliche words because they're expected and boring.
- Writing is learned by imitation.
- Get into the habit of using a dictionary and a thesaurus.
- Also bear in mind, when choosing words, how they sound.
- Remember rhythm.
- Consider sound and rhythm every time you write.
- An occasional short sentence can carry a tremendous punch.
- Like so.
- Words are the only tools you have.

## Chapter 7: Usage

- Does the word have a real need?
- E.g. The word "myself" can always be replaced by "me".
- Infer doesn't mean imply.
- The reader infers, the speaker implies.

# Part II: Methods

## Chapter 8: Unity

- You learn to write by writing.
- Unity is the anchor of good writing.
- One choice is unity of pronoun.
- E.g. First person vs third person.
- Unity of tense is another choice.
- E.g. Present vs past.
- Unity of mood is another.
- E.g. Informal vs formal.
- Instead of controlling his writing, his writing is controlling him.
- Every writing project must be reduced before you start to write.
- Every piece of nonfiction should leave the reader with one provocative thought. Not two, not three, but one.

## Chapter 9: The Lead and the Ending

- The most important sentence in any article is the first one.
- The lead must nudge at the readers curiosity and tug at their sleeve.
- The lead can be
    - Fresh
    - Novelty
    - Paradox
    - Humor
    - Surprise
    - Unusual
- You should always collect more material than you will use.
- Another approach is to just tell a story.
- There can be no firm rules for how to write a lead, except for the rule of not letting the reader get away.
- An article that doesn't stop where it should is a drag and a failure.
- A good last sentence should give the reader a lift, and it lingers when the article is over.
- The perfect ending should take your readers slightly by surprise and yet seem exactly right.
- Its like the curtain closing at the end of a play.
- When you're ready to stop, stop.
- What usually works best is a quotation.

## Chapter 10: Bits and Pieces

- Use active verbs.
- E.g. "Joe saw him" vs "He was seen by Joe."
- Verbs are the most important words of all your tools.
- Active verbs push hard; passive verbs tug fitfully.
- Also use precise verbs.
- E.g. Resign, retire, fired instead of stepped down.
- Most adverbs are unnecessary and are redundant.
- E.g. Blared loudly, clenched teeth tightly, effortlessly easy.
- Most adjectives are also unnecessary.
- E.g. Yellow daffodils, brown dirt, quiet ninjas.
- The rule is to make the words do work that needs to be done.
- E.g. "He looked at the gray sky and the black clouds and decided to sail back to the harbor."
- Prune out the small words that qualify how you feel and how you think and what you saw.
- E.g. A bit, sort of, very, too, pretty much.
- Don't hedge your writing with timidities. Be confident and lean.
- The biggest problem with writers using the period is that they don't reach it soon enough.
- The dash has two uses
    - To justify/amplify the first part of the sentence.
    - To set apart a parenthetical thought within a longer sentence.
- Learn to alert the reader to any changes in mood from the previous sentence.
- E.g. But, yet, however, nevertheless, still, instead, thus, therefore, now, later, subsequently.
- You can start sentences with "but" contrary to what we've been taught.
- But don't start sentences with "however" as it's a weaker word and requires careful placement.
- E.g. "it is, however, a weaker word".
- Always make sure your readers are oriented.
- Always ask yourself where you left them in the previous sentence.
- Contractions are informal and can help your writing connect with the reader.
- Always use "that" unless it makes your meaning ambiguous.
- Use "that" over "which" more unless the sentence needs a comma.
- E.g. "The house, which has a roof,"
- "Which" is used to describe, explain, or qualify the phrase that preceded the comma.
- Avoid concept nouns and have people do actions.
- E.g. "The common reaction is incredulous laughter." versus "Most people just laugh with disbelief."
- Also avoid creeping nounism and overstatement.
- Surprisingly often a difficult problem in a sentence can be solved by simply getting rid of it.
- Writing is visual - it catches the eye before it has a chance to catch the brain.
- Paragraphs are a subtle but important part of writing as its the road map that constantly tells the reader how your ideas have been organized.
- To deal with sexist writing
    - Use he or she
    - Use they
    - Use we
    - Use you
- Rewriting is the essence of writing well.
- Writing is an evolving process, not a finished product.
- Rewriting doesn't mean to write multiple drafts, it means to revise and tighten the raw material you wrote on your first try.
- Trust your material.
- Resolve to not let your writing go into slow motion, to not nudge the reader with significance.
- Capture and convey the truth.
- The reader plays a major role in writing and must be given room to play it.
- Don't annoy your reader by overexplaining or telling them how they should feel.
- E.g. Avoid "surprisingly", "predictably", "of course", "interestingly".
- Go with your interests and don't avoid subjects that your passionate about; fearing others have no interest in it.
