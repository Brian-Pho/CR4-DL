Hello and welcome to the CR4-DL (Cradle). On this site, you'll find my notes from

- books that I've enjoyed,
- courses that I've taken,
- papers that I've read, and
- textbooks that I've studied.

## FAQ

### Who are you?

You can visit my [personal website](https://brianpho.com/) to learn more about me but here's a summary.

I'm an undergraduate student studying software engineering and my goal is to become a scientist to achieve my dream of creating artificial general intelligence (AGI).

My current plan is to study computer science, neuroscience, cognitive science, and psychology (pretty much all of the brain sciences) to create the basis for me to generate new ideas about intelligence. I believe this is how we should approach imbuing machines with intelligence; through a biology-inspired approach.

### Why are you doing this?

I started this site with the intention of sharing my knowledge with others and as
an archive that I can quickly refer back to. It also makes my notes look nice and be more organized.

### Why research AI?

I'm pursing AI for multiple reasons.

- The scientist in me does it **in search of the truth.** What is intelligence? Why are we conscious? What does it mean to be human?
- The human in me does it **to help humanity.** An AI could theoretically solve all of our problems. World hunger, immortality, space travel, you name it.
- The child in me does it because **it's fun!** There's so much to explore, learn, and play with. I don't think we should ever forget this child-like innocence about us.
- The adult in me does it because **I can't see myself doing anything else.** Once AI is created, it will be the best at everything which means that whatever I do now will be done better by an AI in the future.

### What's with the name "CR4-DL"?

CR4-DL (pronounced as "cradle") is my homage to the HBO show [Westworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westworld_(TV_series)); a great show that touches on AI, human nature, and reality. This site reflects similar themes and I really enjoyed the show. I think it's a witty name and I'm very proud of it. [More info on the CR4-DL in Westworld.](http://westworld.wikia.com/wiki/Cradle)

### How was this site built?

This site was built by me and is hosted by Github Pages. The Jekyll theme is [Hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) which was heavily modified by me.

### Why study the subjects you've chosen? What's your study plan?

My main goal is the creation of AI (or AGI if you're being technical about it). I'm studying neuroscience because I think of it the "hardware" of the brain with cognitive science as the "software" of the mind. In order to understand the brain, mind, and intelligence, I believe this entire systems approach is necessary. However, the tradeoff is the massive amount of time and effort needed to become PhD/expert level in each field which is why I'm starting early (I'm currently 20 years old as of writing this in 2018).

My plan is to first read through the foundational textbooks in each field to understand the basics of each subject, and then to branch off into papers where the frontier of knowledge is at. Along the way, I plan on studying non-related subjects like critical thinking, writing, and learning to help improve me as a learner, researcher, and person.

### Where can I find updates on your journey?

I've created another site to handle more of the blogging and narrative side of my journey. It's called "Cadence" and you can access it [here](https://brianpho.com/Cadence/).
The ongoing updates are in this post: [My quest for artificial intelligence](https://brianpho.com/Cadence/2019/05/09/my-quest-for-artificial-intelligence.html).

### How do I get in contact with you?

You can contact me via my main website which also has links to my email and social media.

> The field was founded on the claim that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it".

> We humans are alone in this world for a reason. We murdered and butchered anything that challenged our primacy.

> Then you don't remember a world without robots. There was a time when humanity faced the universe alone and without a friend. Now he has creatures to help him; stronger creatures than himself, more faithful, more useful, and absolutely devoted to him. Mankind is no longer alone. Have you ever thought of it that way?

> Instead of trying to produce a programme to simulate the adult mind, why not rather try to produce one which simulates the child's? If this were then subjected to an appropriate course of education one would obtain the adult brain.
