Hello and welcome to the Cradle. On this website, you'll find my notes from

- books that I've enjoyed,
- courses that I've taken,
- papers that I've read, and
- textbooks that I've studied.

## FAQ

### Who are you?

You can visit my [personal website](https://brianpho.com/) to learn more about me but here's a summary. My goal is to help humanity build artificial general intelligence (AGI). I plan to achieve this goal by becoming a neuroscientist and by studying the brain through textbooks, books, and papers. I hope to become the Einstein of neuroscience, although far-fetched and difficult, by synthesizing results from different fields to push our understanding of the brain. However, it isn't enough for me to understand the brain, but to build one. By reverse engineering the brain, I believe we can create an intelligence greater than ourselves.

### Why are you pursuing AGI?

I'm pursuing AGI for multiple reasons.

- The scientist in me does it in **search for the truth**. How does the brain work? Why are we conscious? Why are we different from everything else that's alive?
- The person in me does it to **help humanity**. An AGI could theoretically solve all of our problems. World hunger, immortality, space travel, the perfect government, you name it.
- The child in me does it because it's **fun**! There's so much to explore, learn, and play with. I don't think we should ever forget the innocence within us.
- The adult in me does it because **I can't see myself doing anything else**. Once AGI is created, it will be the best at everything. Which means that whatever I do now, will be done better by an AGI in the future.

### How do you plan on creating AGI?

I plan on creating AGI by first studying the human brain. My approach is to reverse engineer the brain by extracting the core principles of how the brain processes information. Information processing requires two separate, but integrated, parts like computers: hardware and software. The hardware of the brain is the physical implementation of it, cells called neurons. Examples of brain hardware include its inputs and outputs such as the eye, skin, spinal cord, and muscles. The software of the brain is the intangible or emergent properties of it. Examples of brain software include consciousness, visual illusions, and language. By understanding both the hardware and software of the brain, we should have enough information to create it.

### Why did you make this website?

I started this website with the intention of sharing my knowledge and as an archive that I can quickly refer back to. It also makes my notes look nice and be more organized.

### What's with the name "CR4-DL"?

The CR4-DL (pronounced as "Cradle") is my homage to the HBO show [Westworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westworld_(TV_series)). It's an amazing show that touches on AI, human nature, and reality. This website reflects similar themes from the show so I named my website after it. I think it's a witty name and I'm very proud of it. [More info on the CR4-DL in Westworld.](http://westworld.wikia.com/wiki/Cradle)

### How is this website built?

This website is built by me and is hosted by Github Pages. I've redesigned this website three times now, the first time using a simple Jekyll theme, the second time using a more complicated Jekyll theme, and the third time using Gatsby. I've gone through multiple iterations and designs to improve the look-and-feel and the functionality of the website to my liking. I also enjoy web development as it allows me to express my creative side with programming.

### Where can I find updates on your journey?

I've created another website to handle the blogging and narrative side of my journey. It's called Cadence and you can find it [here](https://brianpho.com/Cadence/). Specifically, the AGI updates are in this post: [My quest for artificial intelligence](https://brianpho.com/Cadence/2019/05/09/my-quest-for-artificial-intelligence.html).

### How do I contact you?

You can contact me through my [main website](https://brianpho.com/HTML/contact.html) which has links to my email and social media.

## My Favorite Quotes

> The field was founded on the claim that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it".

[Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence Workshop in 1956](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop)

> We humans are alone in this world for a reason. We murdered and butchered anything that challenged our primacy.

[Dr. Robert Ford in Westworld](https://quotecatalog.com/quotes/tv/westworld/)

> Then you don't remember a world without robots. There was a time when humanity faced the universe alone and without a friend. Now he has creatures to help him; stronger creatures than himself, more faithful, more useful, and absolutely devoted to him. Mankind is no longer alone. Have you ever thought of it that way?

[Isaac Asimov in I, Robot](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41804.I_Robot)

> Instead of trying to produce a programme to simulate the adult mind, why not rather try to produce one which simulates the child's? If this were then subjected to an appropriate course of education one would obtain the adult brain.

[Alan Turing in Computing Machinery and Intelligence](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf)

> To see a World in a Grain of Sand,
