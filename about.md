Hello and welcome to the CR4-DL (Cradle). In this site you'll find my notes that I
took for my university courses, self-taught notes from textbooks, and notes
written based on papers.

## FAQ
### Who are you?
You can visit my [personal website](https://brianpho.com/HTML/about.html) to learn more 
about me but here's the summary. I'm currently an undergraduate student studying 
software engineering at the University of Calgary. My dream (and goal) is to become an AI
researcher who helps push humanity to the creation of artificial general intelligence.

My plan is to study computer science, neuroscience, and cognitive science in depth to 
create the basis for me to generate new ideas about intelligence and how to 
engineer it into a machine.

### Why are you doing this?
I started with blog with the intention of sharing my knowledge to help others and as
an archive that I can quickly refer back to.

I'm studying AI for multiple reasons:
  * In search of the truth. What is intelligence? What is conciousness?
  * To help humanity. An AI could theoretically solve all of our problems.
  * It's fun!

### What's with the name "CR4-DL"?
"CR4-DL" or "Cradle" is my homage to the TV show "Westworld" where copies
of the hosts are contained. This is reflective of how this site is used to
contain my notes but also how I touch on the themes of artificial intelligence,
psychology, conciousness, and reality.

### How was this site built?
This site is currently being hosted on Github Pages and the Jekyll theme used is
[Hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) (heavily modified by me).

### Why study the subjects you've chosen?
TODO: Link the subject posts and add the motivation into them
