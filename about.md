Hello and welcome to the Cradle. In this site you'll find my notes that I
took for my university courses, self-taught notes from textbooks, and notes
written based on papers.


### What's with the name "CR4-DL"?
"CR4-DL" or "Cradle" is my homage to the TV show "Westworld" where copies
of the hosts are contained. This is reflective of how this site is used to
contain my notes but also how I touch on the themes of artificial intelligence,
psychology, conciousness, and reality.
