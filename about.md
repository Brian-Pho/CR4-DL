Hello and welcome to the CR4-DL (Cradle). On this site you'll find my notes from:

- the university courses that I've taken,
- papers that I've found interesting, and

## FAQ

### Who are you?

You can visit my [personal website](https://brianpho.com/HTML/about.html) to learn more
about me but here's a summary.

I'm currently an undergraduate student studying
software engineering at the University of Calgary. My dream (and goal) is to become an artificial intelligence researcher who helps push humanity towards the creation of artificial general intelligence.

My current plan is to study computer science, neuroscience, cognitive science, psychology (pretty much all of the brain sciences) in depth to create the basis for me to generate new ideas about intelligence. I believe this is how we should approach imbuing machines with intelligence.

### Why are you doing this?

I started this site with the intention of sharing my knowledge with others and as
an archive that I can quickly refer back to. It also helps to make my notes look nicer and be more organized.

### Why research AI?

I'm studying AI for multiple reasons:

- **In search of the truth.** What is intelligence? What is consciousness? What does it mean to be human?
- **To help humanity.** An AI could theoretically solve all of our problems. World hunger, immortality, space travel, you name it.
- **It's fun!** I don't think we should ever forget this childlike innocence about us.

### What's with the name "CR4-DL"?

"CR4-DL" or "Cradle" is my homage to the HBO show [Westworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westworld_(TV_series)), a (great) show that touches upon AI, philosophy, and psychology. CR4-DL reflects the same themes of artificial intelligence, psychology, consciousness, and reality. I think it's a witty name and am very proud of it.

### How was this site built?

This site is currently hosted on Github Pages and the Jekyll theme used is
[Hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) (modified by me).

### Why study the subjects you've chosen? What's your study plan?

The reasons can be found on each subject page.

- [Artificial Intelligence]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-07-02-artificial-intelligence %})
- [Neuroscience]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-07-02-neuroscience %})
- [Cognitive Science]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-07-02-cognitive-science %})

In general, my main goal is the creation of AI for which I've posted reasons above. I'm studying neuroscience because I think of it the "hardware" of the brain while cognitive science as the "software". And in order to understand the brain, mind, and intelligence, I believe this entire systems approach is necessary but the tradeoff is the massive amount of time needed to become PhD/expert level in each.

My plan is to first read through the foundational textbooks to understand the basics of each subject and then to branch off into papers where the leading edge is at. Along the way I plan on studying non-related subjects like critical thinking, writing, and learning to help improve me as a learner and researcher.

### How do I get in contact with you?

You can talk to me via my main website. There's a contact page as well as links to my email and social media.

> The field was founded on the claim that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it".

> Then you don't remember a world without robots. There was a time when humanity faced the universe alone and without a friend. Now he has creatures to help him; stronger creatures than himself, more faithful, more useful, and absolutely devoted to him. Mankind is no longer alone. Have you ever thought of it that way?

> Instead of trying to produce a programme to simulate the adult mind, why not rather try to produce one which simulates the child's? If this were then subjected to an appropriate course of education one would obtain the adult brain.
