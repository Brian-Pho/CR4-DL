excerpt: "General lessons from the brain applies to AGI."

This page is a collection of neuroscience findings that I suspect will help us build AGI. Every time I run across a neuroscience idea that triggers my sense of importance and intuition, I will add it here.

| Neuroscience | Source | Artificial Intelligence Suggestion |
|--------------|--------|-------------------------|
| The brain has 86 billion neurons and is matched by none other in terms of the number of neurons in the cerebral cortex | The Human Advantage | We need to build devices of equivalent computing power. The possibility of a device with fewer units of computation but equivalent intelligence is small. Neuromorphic chips may be the answer. |
| The brain has a surprisingly long development time compared to other animals | Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience | AGI should intentionally have a delayed maturation period in order to improve learning and adaptability. This may come in the form of slower learning rates, increase epochs, or the slow development of neural architecture |
| Our best framework for cognitive development is interactive specialization, the idea that we start out with a general structure that becomes more refined over time and as we mature and develop | Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience and Connectome | AGI should start out with some priors but not any specific ones, the general priors should enable further refinement and specialization of the network |
| Intelligence is dependent on consciousness as seen in medical cases of epileptic automatism | The feeling of what happens | AGI should have consciousness to be intelligent. There needs to be some sense of self and identity to attribute feelings and knowledge to. |
