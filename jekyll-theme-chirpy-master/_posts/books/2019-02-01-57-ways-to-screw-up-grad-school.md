## Starting Out

- Questions to ask yourself
  - Why do you want to go to graduate school?
  - What would you like to get out of the experience?
  - What kinds of jobs can you get with your graduate degree?
- Think in both the immediate term and the long term
- Contact the graduate chairs of the programs you're interested in
- It's preferable to not have all of your degrees at the same university
- You need to show that you're a good fit for the program
- Identify potential supervisors beforehand
- If you have multiple offers, tell each university's graduate chair about it
- The PhD must be funded
- Don't major in interdisciplinary studies as that's too general
- Go to your university's writing center for help on writing your Statement of Purpose (SOP)
- Use the university's resources for writing, job searching, resume writing, and career advice
- Keep applying for grants and scholarships in graduate school

## Supervisors

- Itemize all of the attributes that you're looking for in an ideal supervisor
- Don't stay quiet and don't go it alone
- Screwing up your choice of supervisor is one of the biggest missteps you can make in grad school. It's also easy to do
- The availability of an appropriate supervisor should definitely affect your decision about which PhD program to attend
- Don't have more than one supervisor
- Discuss expectations with your supervisor at the earliest stages of your degree
- Don't expect people to hold your hand

## Managing Your Program

- There's more to the degree than the formal requirements
- The key with comprehensive exams is to get them done and out of the way
- Select a topic that you're passionate about
- Get some teaching experience but not too much
- Get teacher training and keep a record of it
- Don't leave the university before completing your degree
- Two of the things that slow your graduating progress are research ethics and research access (E.g. Resources, interviews, finding data)
- Backup your data and work to prevent data loss
- Conferences help provide motivation to write
- Committing to a conference paper on a specific date is a time-honored way of bringing closure to a specific piece of writing
- Go to conferences to learn about the cutting edge developments made by others

## Your Work and Social Life

- Don't neglect the non-academic things in life like hobbies and exercise
- Don't expect family and friends to understand or appreciate the graduate school lifestyle
- Don't socialize with only one group of people
- Get out of your comfort zone
- Don't take a full time job while doing your degree

## Writing

- If you want a career in research or at the university, use your time in grad school to write and publish works over and above your thesis
- Work up parts of your thesis as journal submissions. But the problem is that you likely won't produce clean thesis chapters until late in your PhD program
- Immediately start thinking about writing works other than your thesis
- Don't postpone publishing
- Don't submit the same articles to different outlets at the same time. It's viewed as double dipping
- Be cautious that you don't try to accomplish too much with your thesis
- Be short and succinct, have focus and be mindful of time and scope
- You need to identify what not to cover in your research and to remove tangents peripheral to your analysis or argument
- A thesis, like any written work, is always stronger when you omit unnecessary sections
- You will need to compromise idealized goals in light of the pragmatic need to do the best you can with the resources and time frame available
- Whatever approach you take to your research will not be perfect. You must nonetheless align yourself with and defend you choice of topic, theory, and methodological strategy
- Your writing regime should change in graduate school
- Letting other responsibilities come before your writing is probably the most common barrier to writing a lot
- Manage the situation by setting your own deadlines and by having a daily writing schedule and sticking with it
- Write in the active voice to add life to your sentences
- While the academy often stresses the need to publish, the ultimate aim is to have your work read so that you can help shape the scholarly discussions in your field
- Hold your reader's hand and carefully show them what you're doing
- Eliminate jargon, strive for clear and concise assertions, compose in the active voice, and be kind to your readers.
- Above all, continually strive to improve your writing

## Your Attitude and Actions

- Be kind
- Choose your battles wisely
- Have a thick skin and recognize that failure is normal. Don't think of negative responses as personal attacks
- Be considerate
- Reputation is important
- Joint submissions are prohibited
- Do not be surprised if you have to compromise a bit on your initial vision to satisfy other people's expectation
- Developing an ability to maintain your own vision of a piece of research while also incorporating other people's suggestions will serve you well

## Delicate Matters

- Don't get involved in a romantic relationship with someone who has higher power or someone with lower power due to the inherent power differential
- Don't plagiarize and don't cheat
- Know your rights and use them when appropriate
- Try to solve conflicts at the lowest level possible
- A good supervisor is hard to find, but you can always find people to fall in love with
- Don't have romantic relationships with any faculty
- Keep things professional
- Be humble
- Don't cheat, plagiarize, or copy
- Don't write someone elses work

## Am I Done Yet? On Finishing

- Be sure you have completed all of your requirements to graduate
- Jobs in university, government, or industry
- Attend job talks
- Volunteer to be part of the job search committee
- Read the theses of some of your supervisor's previous students who have landed good jobs or gone on to do a PhD
- Think long term. Jobs after graduating, networking
- Don't get an unknown external examiner for your thesis committee
- Write your thesis with the library guidelines in mind
- Always be open with your supervisor about your problems, delays, and what's currently going on
- Radical truth and radical openness
- When in the graduate degree, reflect on your progress and your rate of progress to determine if you should continue
- Red flags
  - Not feeling motivated
  - Being unable to write
  - Missing deadlines
  - Not keeping up with other students
  - Avoiding your supervisor
  - Failing to manage finances

## Final Thoughts

- Maximize opportunities
- Takes responsibility
- Build healthy professional relationships
- Look for help
- Forge a professional reputation that you will be proud of
