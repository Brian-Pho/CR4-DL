## Note Creation Process

### Style Guide

- Definitions are in italics, don't italicize the colon, end with a period.
- E.g. *Algorithm*: a series of steps that completes a goal.

- End bullet points with periods unless they have sub-bullet points.
- E.g. Blah blah blah
  - No period here
  - Except when the inner points are full sentences or long.

- No newline breaks except between sections within a chapter.
- No colon “:” before nested list.

### Books

1. Write notes in Dropbox Paper.
2. Export notes in Markdown and copy them to site.
3. Download images and fix to compile with linter.
4. Replace image URLs with local ones.
5. Compress images with TinyPNG.
6. Test locally.

### Textbooks

- Parts are in roman numerals
- Chapters are in digits
- VS Code Replace "  - (.*[^*]):" with "  - *$1*:".
