Key enablers of growing a mind\n<ol>\n<li>Babies’ information processing is guided and constrained from birth\n<ul>\n<li>It’s a mistaken belief that the infant brain architecture isn’t mature; a lot of structure is already present.</li>\n<li>Structural connectivity patterns in infants are very similar to adult structural connectivity.</li>\n<li>Functional area activation is also similar to adults.</li>\n<li>Newborns also show a bias and this differs from inborn knowledge in that they’re part of the learning mechanism but not directly inherited.</li>\n<li>The earliest information processing is constrained by neural architecture and guided by cognitive biases.</li>\n<li>Importance in the starting conditions and in the pre-wiring and pre-training of neural networks.</li>\n<li>Infants don’t have to start their developmental trajectory from a blank slate and neither should neural networks.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Babies are learning statistical relations across diverse inputs\n<ul>\n<li>Infants readily learn associations. E.g. Sensorimotor handling of objects, voices and faces, and language.</li>\n<li>Major difference between infant and NN statistical learning is the multi- and cross-modal nature of infants’ learning processes.</li>\n<li>E.g. Visual and auditory, visual and tactile, auditory and tactile, and external and bodily signals.</li>\n<li>Suspect the mechanism is the detection of temporal synchrony.</li>\n<li>Much greater need for learning from diverse multimodal inputs than one might guess necessary for unimodal tasks.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Babies’ input is scaffolded in time\n<ul>\n<li>Changes in sensory and motor possibilities (such as crawling and walking) not only allow infants to explore different aspects of their environment, they also drive the expansion of the range of obtained inputs in the direction of increasingly varied stimuli and in complex combinations of the stimuli.</li>\n<li>This development leads naturally to a phased-structure in their learning input and creates a guided curriculum for infant learning.</li>\n<li>Critical periods reflect a moment of peak plasticity during a specific developmental state.</li>\n<li>The initial learning (critical period) plays a key role in determining the outcome of the training processes, and shortcomings/biases during early training may not be recoverable.</li>\n<li>Catastrophic forgetting is also a result of the stability/plasticity dilemma where new knowledge overwrites rather than integrates with previous knowledge.</li>\n<li>The quest to achieve continual learning without overwriting previously acquired knowledge remains unfinished.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Babies actively seek out learning opportunities\n<ul>\n<li>Infants play an active role in directing their attention to stimuli to learn.</li>\n<li>E.g. Curiosity-driven learning, active learning, learning by intrinsic motivation.</li>\n<li>Three levels of arousal\n<ul>\n<li>Relaxation (low arousal)</li>\n<li>Curiosity (optimal/middle arousal)</li>\n<li>Anxiety (high arousal)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Infants attend significantly longer to stimuli at an intermediate level of complexity (at the bottom of the U-shaped curve of attention as a function of novelty or complexity).</li>\n<li>It’s suspected that this depends on the degree of encoding of the stimulus.</li>\n<li>Curiosity can been coded into NN in many different ways.</li>\n<li>E.g. Attending to inputs for which predictability is minimal or maximal, seeing out information as a function of its compressibility, maximizing stimulus novelty relative to its internal states.</li>\n<li>One paper created an agent with a world-model that learned to predict the consequences of the agent’s actions, and a meta-cognitive self-model that tracks the performance of the world-model. The self-model was able to improve the world-model by adversarially challenging it.</li>\n<li>Instead of attention allocation, active learning can also use active intervention for learning.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Babies learn from other agents\n<ul>\n<li>Parental scaffolding where parents help and guide their infant and the quality of play increases to an extent that couldn’t have been achieved by the infant alone.</li>\n<li>Learning by observation and imitation has been explored too.</li>\n<li>Would parenting an algorithm not make it supervised learning?</li>\n<li>By being a meta-learner, parents/teachers can push infants to enter a new, steeper learning curve.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Improving the quality, flexibility and efficiency of learned representations will directly translate to improved ML performance.</li>\n<li>The current approach to unsupervised ML, to remove targeted interference in the learning processes as much as possible and leave everything to be learned from the data, stands in stark contrast to infant learning.</li>\n<li>Two overarching insights from the five lessons\n<ul>\n<li>There is more structure to constrain and guide infants’ learning processes.</li>\n<li>Infants’ learning opportunities are more flexible and richer.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3

brain</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Understanding the brain means two things\n<ul>\n<li>What does the brain do?</li>\n<li>How does it do it?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Paper argues that behavior is often more useful than neuroscientific measurements for answering the first question.</li>\n<li>Neuroscience is focused more on the level of neurons than on the level of organisms.</li>\n<li>Neural firing patterns are the wrong level for investigating many pressing questions in neuroscience.</li>\n<li>An example of how a full neural description guarantees very little understanding is the worm C. elegans.</li>\n<li>We have the full connectome of C. elegans and yet are unable to explain its behavior.</li>\n<li>Cutting-edge methods for recording and manipulating the brain have, for the most part, verified what we already knew from behavior, rather than led to novel insight.</li>\n<li>Brain perturbation studies are necessary for answering questions about localization, but behavior remains the standard for theories about the roles and computations carried out by different neural structures.</li>\n<li>What has neuroscience taught us about cognition that we didn’t already know from behavior?</li>\n<li>Paper argues that we have “not [learned] very much at all.”</li>\n<li>One example is that scientists were able to infer that color vision is due to three types of neurons, which was later verified by physiologists.</li>\n<li>Key example\n<ul>\n<li>Assume a T-shaped maze and a rat must choose which arm to travel to obtain food.</li>\n<li>To remember the location of food, the rat either uses internal, egocentric cues such as turning right, or it uses external, environmental cues such as an arrow or window.</li>\n<li>Imagine you could record activity from anywhere in the rat’s brain during this experience, how could you determine which strategy the rat was using?</li>\n<li>It’s extremely difficult to determine the rat’s strategy from its neural activity.</li>\n<li>Perturbing the rat’s brain wouldn’t work either as by manipulating the brain, we can find out what brain areas can affect behavior on this task, but not what brain areas do affect behavior.</li>\n<li>A simple modification of the maze (turning it 180 degrees) lead to the insight that rats use external cues to decide.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Another example is that of reinforcement learning (RL). From behavioral studies, it was worked out that dopamine is a key neurotransmitter in prediction of errors.</li>\n<li>RL is a prime case of behavior and computation informing our understanding of neural mechanisms, not the other way around.</li>\n<li>In recent years, the rise of neuroscience has been accompanied by a disdain of behavioral research.</li>\n<li>Major neuroscience organizations, such as The Journal of Neuroscience and the National Institute of Mental Health, all share the implicit/explicit assumption that behavior can’t lead to valid neuroscientific findings.</li>\n<li>Examples of true discoveries about perception and cognition that weren’t know from studies of behavior include\n<ul>\n<li>Hodgkin-Huxley Action Potential Model.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Paper argues that a combination of behavioral and neural measurements leads to the best insights. Pure behavioral research is not only critical for understanding the mind, it’s also important for understanding how mental processes are implemented in the brain.</li>\n<li>There’s a strong bias in neuroscience for causal manipulation (E.g. optogentics) rather than correlational measurements (fMRI).</li>\n<li>Because behavioral work is sometimes easier and often cheaper, its findings are worth less and findings from expensive neuroscientific research.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"towards-readable-code-in-neuroscience\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#towards-readable-code-in-neuroscience\" aria-label=\"towards readable code in neuroscience permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Towards readable code in neuroscience</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Code has become central to neuroscience, and the neuroscience community must take steps to ensure its reproducibility and best coding practices.</li>\n<li>Mistakes in scientific software can have profound impacts.</li>\n<li>E.g.
