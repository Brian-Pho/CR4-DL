auditory cortex</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Is the cortex of a given sensory modality uniquely specified to process inputs of that modality, or can it, under certain conditions, process input of another modality?</li>\n<li>This paper answers this question by routing visual inputs into the auditory pathway during development and by studying the resulting visual responses of cells in the auditory cortex.</li>\n<li>Specifically, retinal afferents in the ferret were induced to innervate the auditory thalamus or medial geniculate nucleus (MGN).</li>\n<li>This results in visual input to cells in the primary auditory cortex (A1) of the “rewired” ferret with a topographic visual map there.</li>\n<li>To induce retinal innervation of nonvisual thalamic structures, we need to remove the normal retinal targets, mainly the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the superior colliculus (SC).</li>\n<li>The SC was ablated by cautery and the LGN was retrograde degenerated by cauterizing large regions of the visual cortex.</li>\n<li>All lesions were made unilaterally as bilateral lesions significantly reduced survival rates.</li>\n<li>These lesions induce the development of retinal afferents into the MGN.</li>\n<li>Since the normal thalamocortical connectivity from the MGN to primary auditory cortex (A1) is retained, an aberrant visual pathway from the retina to MGN to A1 is established.</li>\n<li>In both normal and rewired animals, stimulating electrodes were lowered into the optic chiasm and recording electrodes were lowered into V1 and A1.</li>\n<li>Three major differences between the visual units in A1 and V1\n<ol>\n<li>Responsivity\n<ul>\n<li>Most cells in V1 responded in robust and consistent fashion to visual stimuli, but cells in A1 were much more difficult to drive, exhibited unstable responses, and responded with fewer spikes.</li>\n<li>The poor responsivity of A1 cells often made receptive field characterization of A1 cells difficult and time consuming.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Receptive field size\n<ul>\n<li>The receptive field sizes (average length and width of the field) of visual cells in A1 were significantly larger than those of V1 cells.</li>\n<li>The mean diameter of receptive fields in A1 was almost three times that of V1 cells.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Latency\n<ul>\n<li>Cells in A1 and V1 also differed in their latencies to optic chiasm stimulation.</li>\n<li>A1 cells took significantly longer to respond to stimulation compared to V1 cells.</li>\n<li>There was no correlation between the latency to optic chiasm stimulation and cortical depth, receptive field size, or responsivity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>These differences seem to come from the properties of retinal and thalamic input to A1 and V1.</li>\n<li>Similarities between the visual units in A1 and V1\n<ol>\n<li>Ocular dominance\n<ul>\n<li>In V1, we recorded mostly from contralaterally dominated cells, with 65% of all units tested being completely contralateral dominant and only 10% being ipsilateral dominant.</li>\n<li>In A1, a similar ocular dominance distribution was seen with 66% being completely contralaterally dominant and 7% being ipsilateral dominant.</li>\n<li>Approximately 30% of units recorded in both A1 and V1 are binocular.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Receptive field types\n<ul>\n<li>Receptive fields of cells in V1 are classified as simple or complex and in general, resembles those seen in cats, minks, and ferrets.</li>\n<li>While it’s difficult to determine the receptive fields of cells in A1 due to being large, similar receptive field structures were observed.</li>\n<li>Not only do simple, complex, and non-oriented cell types occur in A1, they also occur in proportions similar to that found in

tuning, we used responses to flashing bars at various orientations.</li>\n<li>Cells in A1 respond with fewer spikes overall than those in V1 and their responses appear to be modulated less strongly

orientation strength nor orientation tuning width revealed any quantitative difference between A1 and V1 with respect to orientation tuning.</li>\n<li>One unexpected finding was that the velocity tuning of cells in A1 were similar to those in V1.</li>\n<li>Most cells were tuned to either slow, medium, or fast velocities.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>We find that receptive field properties of visual cells in rewired A1 are remarkably similar to those in normal V1.</li>\n<li>Generation of visual receptive field properties in A1\n<ul>\n<li>The cortical areas that project to A1 in rewired animals are the same areas that project to A1 in normal animals, and don’t include any visual cortical areas.</li>\n<li>The degree of similarity between A1 and V1 is apparent not only in the orientation, direction, and velocity selectivity of cells, but also in the types of receptive field organizations found there.</li>\n<li>Both V1 and A1 contain simple and complex receptive field types and in roughly similar proportions.</li>\n<li>We argue that the generation of these cortical receptive field organizations and tuning properties isn’t dependent on the input cell type, but arises via intracortical circuitries activated by a minimum of visual input.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Do inputs specify intracortical circuitry?\n<ul>\n<li>One interpretation of these data is that visual input during development actually instructs the establishment of specific cortical circuits in A1.</li>\n<li>In this view, the temporal patterns of sensory activity unique to each sensory modality actively instruct the development of specific cortical circuits, possibly from an initial cortical template.</li>\n<li>It’s known that the development of functional properties of cells in the primary visual cortex can be modified by changes in visual input.</li>\n<li>E.g. Changing the quality and quantity of activity can greatly influence the establishment of ocular dominance in visual cortex.</li>\n<li>In the rewired ferrets, we have replaced auditory input with visual input at a time when cortical circuits haven’t yet been fully established.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Do sensory cortices share common processing circuits?\n<ul>\n<li>Another interpretation of these data is that A1 and V1 share certain similar processing circuits, and that visual inputs to A1 simply activate circuits normally present in A1.</li>\n<li>A1 thus comes to exhibit visual receptive field properties similar to those in normal V1.</li>\n<li>Physiologically, many neurons in A1 respond selectively to the direction and rate of frequency modulation.</li>\n<li>If sensory cortices share some common processing circuits, then these circuits can be established regardless of input modality during development.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Our results show that the sensory neocortex isn’t uniquely specified to process inputs of a single modality.</li>\n<li>Auditory cortex can accept and process visual input in a way very similar to those in normal visual cortex.</li>\n<li>Whether these functional similarities are due to input-induced changes in intracortical circuitry or to intrinsic commonalities across sensory cortices is unknown.</li>\n<li>A view consistent with neural development is that basic intracortical connections are established independent of afferents, while input activity would play a role in the fine-tuning of these connections.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"hierarchical-organization-of-cortical-and-thalamic-connectivity\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#hierarchical-organization-of-cortical-and-thalamic-connectivity\" aria-label=\"hierarchical organization of cortical and thalamic connectivity permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1716-z\">Hierarchical organization of cortical and thalamic connectivity</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Connectomes exist at different levels of granularity from single cells to populations to entire areas.</li>\n<li>It’s unclear whether the idea of a cortical hierarchy can be applied globally across the entire cortex, and how it arises from connections made by different classes of neurons.</li>\n<li>Each cortical region comprises distinct types of excitatory neurons that are largely organized by layers, but also by long-distance projection patterns: intratelencephalic (IT) in L2-L6, pyramidal tract (PT) in L5, and corticothalamic (CT) in L6.</li>\n<li>For thalamocortical (TC) connections, input to L4 is considered feedforward, and input to L1 is considered feedback.</li>\n<li>For corticothalamic (CT) connections, input from L6 is considered feedback, and input from L5 is considered feedforward.</li>\n<li>We hypothesize that a unifying hierarchical organization across the entire cortex and its major input structure, the thalamus, is governed by a set of anatomical rules for corticocortical (CC), corticothalamic (CT), and thalamocortical (TC) connections.</li>\n<li>Results show that the mouse cortex and thalamus form an integrated hierarchical organization.</li>\n<li>Skipping over the Cre drivers for cortical projection mapping.</li>\n<li>Unlike the cortex, which is organized into distinct projection classes within layers of a single region, thalamic nuclei have relatively homogenous populations of cortically projecting neurons.</li>\n<li>Some CT projections clearly travel through thalamic regions before reaching their final targets and form synapses in those areas.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

Masking, rivalry, or the difference between sleep and wakefulness.</li>\n<li>An important note is that we aren’t trying to compare specific ToCs against each other, but rather compare ideas and principles of ToCs against each other.</li>\n<li>The ultimate goal is to reduce the number of ToCs because not all of them can be correct.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Empirical phenomena of consciousness\n<ul>\n<li>Two main aspects of consciousness\n<ul>\n<li>State</li>\n<li>Content</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A ToC may address the state or content of consciousness, or ideally both.</li>\n<li>We have the intuitive feeling that state consciousness is graded.</li>\n<li>E.g. From brain death to coma to anesthesia to sleep to drowsiness to fully alert.</li>\n<li>Even within these states there seems to be a continuum.</li>\n<li>However, it’s unclear to what extent this intuition is correct.</li>\n<li>We also intuitively feel that we only have a single consciousness at one moment in time.</li>\n<li>The unconscious integration period can last for 420 ms in experiments with masking.</li>\n<li>This raises the question of whether consciousness is a continuous or discrete stream of percepts.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Hard criteria for empirical theories of consciousness\n<ul>\n<li>Paradigm cases</li>\n<li>Unfolding argument</li>\n<li>Small and large network argument</li>\n<li>Other systems argument</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Paradigm cases of consciousness: empirical phenomena that are focused specifically on consciousness and not other co-occurring aspects.\n<ul>\n<li>E.g.

Imagery, bodily sensations, affective experiences.</li>\n<li>Global states of consciousness aren’t distinguished from each other based on objects or features, but instead are distinguished based on cognitive, behavioral, and physiological grounds.</li>\n<li>This paper argues that the levels-based conception of global states of consciousness is unsupportable and offers an alternative of multidimensional analysis of global states.</li>\n<li>If the notion of a level of consciousness has no sound basis, then it’s unclear whether attempts to measure it or develop theories of it will be successful.</li>\n<li>Levels of consciousness implies that consciousness comes in degrees, and that changes in a creature’s global state of consciousness can be represented as changes along a single dimension.</li>\n<li>E.g. From total unconsciousness (death) to vivid wakefulness.</li>\n<li>Is this claim plausible? Can creatures be ordered on the basis of how conscious they are?</li>\n<li>Two problems with this claim\n<ul>\n<li>According to the standard conception of consciousness, a creature is conscious if and only if it possesses a subjective point of view. Arguably, this property of having a subjective point of view isn’t gradable and it can’t come in degrees.\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. A person can’t be conscious of more objects and properties than another person.</li>\n<li>To be conscious of more isn’t the same as to be more conscious.</li>\n<li>E.g. A sighted person is conscious of more contents than a blind person, but they aren’t more conscious than a blind person.</li>\n<li>It’s controversial whether the contents of consciousness can be graded in terms of their degree of consciousness.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There’s good reason to doubt whether all global states can be assigned a determinate ordering relative to each other.\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. REM sleep versus light levels of sedation. Although level-based analysis states that one of these states must be absolutely higher than the other, the authors see no reason to grant that claim.</li>\n<li>Attempts to impose an absolute ordering on global states of consciousness may be as futile as attempts to impose such an ordering on economies.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The lesson to take away from this analysis is that although the notion of a conscious level serves as a useful shortcut by drawing attention to certain relations between global conscious states, it shouldn’t be treated as a legitimate theoretical construct in the science of consciousness.</li>\n<li>Consciousness in one-dimensional terms is no more plausible than attempts to model intelligence in one-dimensional terms.</li>\n<li>Multiple dimensions of analysis are needed to capture the various ways in which consciousness manifests in different global states.</li>\n<li>However, providing this multidimensional account of consciousness requires a much more detailed understanding of consciousness than which we currently have.</li>\n<li>In this paper, we focus on only two of the many dimensions that structure global states.</li>\n<li>The first dimension concerns the contents of consciousness.\n<ul>\n<li>We suggest that global states differ from each other in terms of how they gate conscious content.</li>\n<li>In many global states, the contents of consciousness appear to be gated in various ways with individuals only experiencing a restricted range of contents.</li>\n<li>E.g. Minimally conscious state (MCS) patients can represent the low-level features of objects, but they’re typically unable to represent the categories that perceptual objects belong to.</li>\n<li>Variations in the gating of conscious contents is likely to provide one dimension along which global states can be hierarchically organized.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The second dimension concerns functional dimensions.\n<ul>\n<li>In ordinary waking awareness, the contents of consciousness are typically available to guide a wide range of cognitive and behavioral processes.</li>\n<li>E.g. Verbal report, intentional agency, attentional control, reasoning, executive processing.</li>\n<li>The fact that cognitive and behavioral control can fragment in certain neurological disorders provides us with another dimension for modelling consciousness.</li>\n<li>It’s possible that there are two global states which both exhibit functional impairments but where there’s no ordering in which the functional impairments is worse in one than in the other.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The central idea, and the alternative to the level-based conception of global consciousness, is that global states can be thought of as regions within a multidimensional state space.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 941px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/CR4-DL/static/994bb119735d17782ea89e420cc2bb9e/a8417/figure1-13.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 94.8%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Figure 1\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/CR4-DL/static/994bb119735d17782ea89e420cc2bb9e/a8417/figure1-13.png\"\n        srcset=\"/CR4-DL/static/994bb119735d17782ea89e420cc2bb9e/63868/figure1-13.png 250w,\n/CR4-DL/static/994bb119735d17782ea89e420cc2bb9e/0b533/figure1-13.png 500w,\n/CR4-DL/static/994bb119735d17782ea89e420cc2bb9e/a8417/figure1-13.png 941w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 941px) 100vw, 941px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Although the dimensions of the state space are unexplored, we suggest that one dimension tracks the gating of contents and another tracks the functional capacities associated with consciousness.</li>\n<li>Global states of consciousness are best understood as regions in a multidimensional space.</li>\n<li>The task of identifying the dimensions of this space will lead to a better understanding of consciousness itself.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"the-hornswoggle-problem\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-hornswoggle-problem\" aria-label=\"the hornswoggle problem permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~drkelly/ChurchlandTheHornswoggleProblem1996.pdf\">The hornswoggle problem</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>This paper focuses on whether anything positive can be gained from the ‘hard problem’ of consciousness or whether this conceptualization is counterproductive.</li>\n<li>Review of Thomas Nagel’s paper ‘What is it like to be a bat?’ and David Chalmers argument that consciousness isn’t neuroscientifically tractable.</li>\n<li>What’s the reason for drawing the division between the easy and hard problems of consciousness?</li>\n<li>Left-out hypothesis: what’s the evidence that we could explain all of the ‘easy’ phenomena and still not understand the neural mechanisms for consciousness?

Anesthesia may disrupt some previously unknown local gating mechanism that regulates the propagation of activity patterns in the thalamocortical system.</li>\n<li>From an information flow point of view, the large layer 5 pyramidal (L5p) neurons have a strategic role because they’re at the intersection of corticocortical and thalamocortical loops.</li>\n<li>Studies have found that a particular region of apical dendrite on L5p neurons serves as a gate or switch, enabling or breaking global brain dynamics.</li>\n<li>Given the L5p neuron’s location, morphology, and long-range projections within and outside the cortex, it isn’t only a nexus of information flow in the mammalian brain, but also encapsulates the input and output function of the cortical column.</li>\n<li>The complexity of L5p neurons can be reduced to the three main dendritic arborizations that collect synaptic input.</li>\n<li>Three L5p compartments\n<ul>\n<li>Apical compartment: a central element that integrates contextual information from the corticocortical and thalamocortical loops.</li>\n<li>Basal compartment: receives feedforward input from specific areas lower in the processing hierarchy and long-range feedback input.</li>\n<li>Coupling compartment: mediates interactions between the apical and basal compartments, enabling flexible combinations of the data streams that are anatomically segregated at the apical and basal compartments.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 833px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/CR4-DL/static/0a98bf6bfb365211a60cf1fadd6a4e0e/5205c/figure2-15.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 124.8%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Figure 2\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/CR4-DL/static/0a98bf6bfb365211a60cf1fadd6a4e0e/5205c/figure2-15.png\"\n        srcset=\"/CR4-DL/static/0a98bf6bfb365211a60cf1fadd6a4e0e/63868/figure2-15.png 250w,\n/CR4-DL/static/0a98bf6bfb365211a60cf1fadd6a4e0e/0b533/figure2-15.png 500w,\n/CR4-DL/static/0a98bf6bfb365211a60cf1fadd6a4e0e/5205c/figure2-15.png 833w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 833px) 100vw, 833px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Experimental control of L5p neurons depends on optogenetic control of the apical compartment.</li>\n<li>Stimulation of the apical compartment led to high-frequency firing of the neuron.

Simultaneous input to the apical and basal compartments leads to a burst of APs, signaling a match between data streams.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>DIT is compatible with the idea that the two information streams on L5p neurons are predictions and prediction errors.</li>\n<li>Any theory that tries to explain how the brain works should try to accommodate the fact that intrinsically, L5p cells compute the match between top-down and bottom-up information streams.</li>\n<li>Which cognitive streams are integrated?</li>\n<li>According to DIT, each cortical column is signaling to the rest of the brain whether the sensory or cognitive feature represented in that column is present (in the real or imagined world).</li>\n<li>Thus, processing that involves the basal compartment without being coupled to the apical compartment is nonconscious. In contrast, strong activation of the apical compartments might be able to generate conscious experiences like dreaming.</li>\n<li>The architecture and biophysical properties of the L5p neurons enable flexible integration of segregated data streams.</li>\n<li>Dendritic integration of segregated data streams might be the defining characteristic of conscious processing.</li>\n<li>What’s the exact role of the HO thalamus in dendritic integration and consciousness?</li>\n<li>It appears that HO thalamus controls coupling within the L5p neurons and, conversely, the L5p neurons convey information to the HO thalamus.</li>\n<li>This would also explain why the state and contents of consciousness are intertwined as contents are represented by a specific subset of L5p neurons projecting to HO thalamus, but that these L5p neurons only contribute to conscious experience when their compartments are coupled, which is controlled by HO thalamus.</li>\n<li>Two main claims of this paper\n<ul>\n<li>Consciousness relies on the dendritic integration of two anatomically and functionally segregated data streams.</li>\n<li>Global dynamics of the conscious brain are gated by specific cellular mechanisms.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"the-evolution-of-the-brain-the-human-nature-of-cortical-circuits-and-intellectual-creativity\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-evolution-of-the-brain-the-human-nature-of-cortical-circuits-and-intellectual-creativity\" aria-label=\"the evolution of the brain the human nature of cortical circuits and intellectual creativity permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fnana.2011.00029\">The evolution of the brain, the human nature of cortical circuits, and intellectual creativity</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>This paper discusses the issue of our humanity from a neurobiological and historical perspective.</li>\n<li>It’s commonly believed that the increase in complexity as our brain has evolved is the product of more microcircuits with a similar basic structure that incorporates only minor variations.</li>\n<li>Indeed, species-specific behaviors may arise from very small changes in neuronal circuits and we see the same in humans.

Sensation, perception, attention, imagination, emotion, moviation, memory, etc.</li>\n<li>Where do these subentities come from? We’re not sure.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What are we aware of?\n<ul>\n<li>Descartes proposed that human consciousness or thought is known directly and that the external world is known only by inference.</li>\n<li>However, despite this encouraging prospect of studying consciousness through direct inspection or introspection, we don’t learn much about consciousness.</li>\n<li>It’s widely understood now that much of the activity of the nervous system isn’t available to introspection.</li>\n<li>E.g. Standing requires slight swaying movements that you aren’t aware of.</li>\n<li>Even solving difficult intellectual problems appears to have a large non-conscious component.</li>\n<li>It’s evident that accounts of one’s own mental processes may be quite inaccurate.</li>\n<li>People must make use of external factors to infer the internal causes of their own behavior. If pressed to explain why they performed some particular action, people tend to invent some socially acceptable explanation.</li>\n<li>E.g. Patients become aware of their own neurological deficits only after observing their own impaired behavior suggests that the internal causes of behavior aren’t open to introspection.</li>\n<li>E.g. In Penfield’s experiments, neurosurgical patients are generally unaware of the presence of electrical stimulation in their cortical speech areas.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>According to Descartes, the human mind has direct knowledge of only its own thoughts and is forever imprisoned inside a brain with only indirect and imperfect knowledge of the outside world.</li>\n<li>However, lay people and scientists have the opposite opinion, that the external world is real and understandable, while the mind is a mysterious entity.</li>\n<li>The commonsense view may be closer to the truth than the theory developed by Descartes.</li>\n<li>E.g. When looking at a chair, you’re more aware of the chair than of the complex sensory processes occurring in your nervous system.</li>\n<li>What we’re aware of appears to us as an external reality, even when that reality is illusory.</li>\n<li>Awareness of internal states\n<ul>\n<li>Not only are we aware of the external world, but we’re also aware of internal bodily states and of our thoughts.</li>\n<li>A major problem in this field is how people learn to talk about things that others have no sensory access to.</li>\n<li>E.g. Children presumably learn to talk about external events by joint observation with an adult who knows how to speak, but then how does a child learn to label an internal state such as a feeling or hunger? The child can’t accompany the adult in subjective feelings.</li>\n<li>In such cases, the adult must infer the presence of hunger on the basis of external factors such as the child’s behavior in eating ravenously or by the fact that nothing has been eaten for some time.</li>\n<li>These external factors are correlated with the interoceptive and proprioceptive sensory information available to the child.</li>\n<li>Eventually, the child learns to identify hunger on the basis of internal sensory information alone, even in the absence of the behavior of eating.</li>\n<li>It seems likely that the verbal labeling of one’s own internal states is much more variable from person to person than the verbal labeling of external objects.</li>\n<li>Thinking or imagination appears to be related to activation of motor processes (and their inevitable sensory consequences), which vary depending on the thought or imagination.</li>\n<li>Awareness of limb movement, whether real or phantom, appears to be totally dependent on sensory feedback because if the feedback is cut off, patients can’t tell if their limb is moving or not.</li>\n<li>The corollary discharge isn’t sufficient to produce a perception of movement in cut-off sensory patients.</li>\n<li>Therefore, any knowledge of our movements that we have seem to be largely or entirely a consequence of feedback from proprioceptors.</li>\n<li>One conclusion suggested by all of this is that what we’re primarily aware of when we consciously think or imagine anything is sensory feedback from peripheral muscle activity.</li>\n<li>Maybe conscious thought and imagination are initial behavior but without the follow through.</li>\n<li>There’s a general agreement that a large part of conscious human thought involves inner speech.</li>\n<li>Like many motor activities, imagination is largely under voluntary control.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The privacy of experience\n<ul>\n<li>One can’t communicate one’s own subjective experience to another person.</li>\n<li>E.g. It’s impossible to explain what a mango tastes like to someone who has never eaten one. A person blind from birth can’t know what visual experience is like.</li>\n<li>Without having the experience ourselves, we can’t hope to understand what it feels like to experience what someone else is experiencing.</li>\n<li>Attempts to penetrate the subjective world of other species are even more hopeless as pointed by Nagel in his paper “What is it like to be a bat?”</li>\n<li>It’s often suggested that the blindsight phenomenon demonstrates that visual awareness depends on the visual cortex.</li>\n<li>If we take the view that the absence of appropriate speech indicates the absence of subjective awareness, then we would have to deny the existence of awareness in preverbal children, severely demented patients, aphasics, deaf mutes, and all non-human animals.</li>\n<li>However, if we accept this, then why do we conclude that patients with blindsight are unconscious of visual stimuli merely because they can’t report them verbally?</li>\n<li>The absence of verbal report need not mean absence of consciousness.</li>\n<li>We’re no longer as certain as Descartes was that the presence of verbal assertions is necessarily proof of conscious awareness.</li>\n<li>Anton’s syndrome is like the mirror of blindsight in that patients claim to see but can’t demonstrate vision on objective tests.</li>\n<li>It’s clear that verbal assertions, or any behaviors, aren’t always reliable indicators of conscious experience.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How can one distinguish a behavioral reaction that depends on physiological mechanisms alone from one that depends on both physiological mechanisms and a mental process?</li>\n<li>There seems to be a dissociation between memory and consciousness as we can have one without the other.</li>\n<li>E.g. During dreaming, we’re conscious but have no memory of the experience.</li>\n<li>Is it that complex behavior can occur in the absence of consciousness or that subjects were conscious but amnesic at the time of experience?</li>\n<li>The size of the central nervous system is often mentioned as a possible factor in the occurrence of consciousness.</li>\n<li>While many people wouldn’t grant our spinal cord as conscious with 13.5 million neurons, people would grant animals with fewer neurons as having some sort of consciousness.</li>\n<li>E.g. Crabs and insects.</li>\n<li>The difficulty with all proposals to establish objective criteria for conscious awareness is that they assume the very point that requires demonstration.</li>\n<li>E.g. It’s impossible to show that any behavioral or physiological phenomenon is correlated with awareness unless we have some previous direct means of identifying the presence and absence of awareness.</li>\n<li>Questions about the mind: philosophy or science?\n<ul>\n<li>It’s been said that philosophy deals with fascinating questions which have no answers, while science deals with boring questions that can be answered.</li>\n<li>Which living species are conscious and which aren’t?\n<ul>\n<li>If bacteria are regarded as conscious, it would be difficult to deny the existence of consciousness in liver cells or white blood cells.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Must we revise our view of the universe to include a mental force capable of modifying the activity of nerve cells?\n<ul>\n<li>In split-brain patients, any conscious awareness that may exist in the right hemisphere can’t be directly communicated to the left hemisphere.</li>\n<li>Further, the greatest wish of a quadriplegic or paraplegic patient can’t cross a transverse section of the spinal cord.</li>\n<li>Human behavior is dependent on transmission through neurons, nothing else.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Where is consciousness located in the nervous system?\n<ul>\n<li>There appears to be no rational criterion for deciding whether conscious awareness is or isn’t associated with any particular part of the brain or spinal cord.</li>\n<li>It’s often said that brain stem activity is related to the presence of consciousness while cortical activity is related to the content of consciousness.</li>\n<li>However, no observer can have access to the subjective experience of a brain-damaged patient.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Brain and mind\n<ul>\n<li>The author argues that ancient theories of the mind, such as perception, emotion, cognition, and memory, should be abandoned because they mislead and encourage the continued use of ineffective methods.</li>\n<li>Mentalistic terms such as attention, cognition, fear, belief, or desire aren’t easily defined since they commonly refer vaguely to several distinct things.</li>\n<li>We don’t need internal representations when the real world is all around us.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Brain and behavior\n<ul>\n<li>An alternative theory to the brain-mind theory is the brain-behavior theory where we start with behavior, not consciousness.</li>\n<li>Brain-behavior theories agree on the necessity of obtaining objective data and the futility of mentalistic interpretations of behavior.</li>\n<li>If mentalistic concepts aren’t to be trusted as guides in working out the functional organization of the brain, how should one proceed with research in the brain-behavior field?</li>\n<li>The author claims that the hippocampal formation doesn’t have any unique role in learning and memory that it doesn’t share with the rest of the cerebral cortex. However, we now know this is false because of patient H.M.</li>\n<li>The theory also predicts that perception is the subthreshold activation of motor patterns by sensory input.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>To make progress in behavioral neuroscience, we must abandon ancient and inappropriate philosophical hypotheses and focus our effects on the attempt to discover the neural basis of behavior, the activities that animals actually perform in their lives.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"the-control-of-neuron-number\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-control-of-neuron-number\" aria-label=\"the control of neuron number permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.ne.11.030188.002231\">The Control of Neuron Number</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Two approaches to the problem of neuron number\n<ul>\n<li>A cellular and molecular approach that focuses on final effects and final causes that regulate neuron number.</li>\n<li>A broader approach on evolutionary, ecological, and bioenergetic reasons for, and consequences of, different strategies used to control the size of neuron populations in different species.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The aim of this paper is to understand the diversity of strategies used to modify neuron number in response to natural selection.</li>\n<li>Neuron number at maturity\n<ul>\n<li>Octopus and small mammals have about 30 million neurons, whales and elephants over 200 billion, and human brains around 85 billion.</li>\n<li>Behavioral complexity isn’t a function of body size, but rather neuron number.</li>\n<li>An increase in body mass doesn’t require a matched increase in number of neurons as neurons can simply be larger or branch more widely.</li>\n<li>Nonetheless, we find that larger individuals and larger species generally do have larger brains that have more neurons.</li>\n<li>In contrast to the lack of data on total neuron number, much more is known about the brain weight of vertebrates.</li>\n<li>Brain weight is proportional to body weight raised by a power from 0.1 to 0.8. The exponent is less than 1 in all cases showing that the increases in brain weight lags behind the increases in body weight.</li>\n<li>The number of neurons and their relative density in different parts of the brain is a determinant of neural function and, thus, behavior.</li>\n<li>E.g. Species with larger brains and more neurons respond to environmental changes with a greater range and versatility of behavior.</li>\n<li>E.g. Newts with less neurons take two to three times as many trials to learn a maze compared to normal newts. Seasonal cycles in neuron number in the song nuclei of canaries correlates well with singing ability.</li>\n<li>However, there’s no generally valid equation that relates neuron number to behavioral complexity.</li>\n<li>Grouping neurons isn’t easy as the variation between neurons may be continuous and not fit discrete categories.</li>\n<li>In contrast to invertebrates, unique neurons are rare in vertebrates.</li>\n<li>It’s important to appreciate that mechanisms that control neuron number also control the range of variation and rates of brain evolution.</li>\n<li>Not only is the variation substantial, but the degree of variation is itself highly variable.</li>\n<li>Do small neuron populations show less variation than large populations? Yes.</li>\n<li>Neurons are greedy cells, taking 18% of circulating oxygen in resting human brains.</li>\n<li>Neurons represent a high and fixed metabolic expense, and the cost of feeding neurons and glia is one of the principal factors that constrain the total size of the neuron population.</li>\n<li>The high cost of neurons in small species predicts that neuronal populations might atrophy or die when not needed and grow back when needed.</li>\n<li>In contrast, large species may be able to afford an abundance of neurons even though they may have no pressing need for these cells.</li>\n<li>Although this does have a small cost, the capacity to retain more neurons than needed increases the range of variation in both neuron number and patterns of deployment.</li>\n<li>Maximizing variation increases the evolutionary plasticity of the lineage, which may provide a store of heritable variation.</li>\n<li>It follows then that the nervous system of small species may be more efficiently designed as each individual neuron works harder.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Control of neuron number by addition\n<ul>\n<li>In most tissues, a deficit of a particular cell type can be fixed by generating new cells, coaxing cells into the depleted region, or by modifying existing cells.</li>\n<li>As a rule, this isn’t the case in the nervous system as the precursor cells capable of producing neurons are either rare or simply don’t exist at late stages of development.</li>\n<li>And neurons themselves can’t divide; they’re postmitotic cells that are unable to reenter a cycle of cell division.</li>\n<li>So, the number of neurons within each part of the nervous system is, with some exceptions, determined at early stages of development, often without any exposure to the environment, an odd situation for an organ system designed to deal with the environment.</li>\n<li>The production and deployment of neurons has to be done the right way the first time, not easy given the extraordinary complexity of the nervous system.</li>\n<li>The number of neurons generated can be controlled in two ways\n<ul>\n<li>Changing the number of stem cells</li>\n<li>Changing the number of descendants each stem cell produces</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Changes in stem cell number and descendant number can be controlled by intrinsic or extrinsic mechanisms.</li>\n<li>In leeches and nematodes, neuron number is under tight control by an inflexible pattern of cell lineage.</li>\n<li>As in invertebrates, the mammalian central nervous system has genes required to produce and maintain the proper number of neurons.</li>\n<li>Findings suggest that specific lineages of neurons require specific genes for the regulation of cell number.</li>\n<li>E.g. The number of Purkinje cells that a given progenitor will produce is as much a characteristic of that progenitor as is the morphological type of the cell.</li>\n<li>Some neuronal populations continue to proliferate after maturity.</li>\n<li>E.g. Arthropod sensory receptors, vertebrate olfactory receptors, and avian telecephalic neurons.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Control of neuron number by cell death\n<ul>\n<li>One of the most counterintuitive and seemingly wasteful processes in brain development is the death of a large fraction of the initial neurons and glia.</li>\n<li>Neuron death isn’t universal throughout the animal kingdom.</li>\n<li>E.g. Zebrafish.</li>\n<li>The elimination of neurons is most pronounced in species that undergo metamorphosis and is least pronounced in vertebrates and invertebrates that don’t metamorphose and that grow throughout life.</li>\n<li>The distribution of dying cells is uneven.</li>\n<li>E.g. In the mammalian neocortex, degeneration is restricted mostly to the upper layers and in the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord.</li>\n<li>Degeneration is most severe in segments that don’t innervate the limbs.</li>\n<li>The most probable reason that neurons die in nematodes isn’t to remove potentially detrimental neurons, but to reduce the organism of unneeded, metabolically demanding cells.</li>\n<li>Neuron death is just the final common pathway of separate processes having separate causes.</li>\n<li>In some cases, neuron death rids the brain of neurons that fail to make correct connections.</li>\n<li>The point being that neuron death appears to have a major role in the final adjustments of ratios of interconnected neurons.</li>\n<li>The larger the nervous system and the more disjointed the production of interconnected cell populations, the more important this fine-tuning will be.</li>\n<li>Neuron loss can be viewed as contributing to an individual’s fitness by improving either the efficiency of information processing or the efficiency of metabolism.</li>\n<li>The combination of overproduction and neuronal death may also provide a buffer and conserve heritable variation, thereby increasing the evolutionary plasticity of a species.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Summary\n<ul>\n<li>It’s useful to view nervous system development as occurring in three overlapping phases.</li>\n<li>The first phase is the development of a genetic nervous system. At the level of the individual, the genetic nervous system is essentially fixed, but over generations it is fluid.</li>\n<li>As this genetic intent interacts within a world of cells, a real brain appears.</li>\n<li>This is the second phase of the embryonic nervous system.</li>\n<li>Neuron numbers are adjusted interactively by changes in proliferative potential and the severity of cell death. Cell fates are established, in part, through interactions with other cells and hormones.</li>\n<li>The third and final phase of development begins when the brain starts to function with the outside world.</li>\n<li>Small changes in neuron number may occur during this period, but these changes are generally of minor functional importance. At this point, the smaller elements of neuronal organization are refined in shape, number, and distribution.</li>\n<li>E.g.

A conjecture on the origin of consciousness</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>This paper addresses the problem: why do conscious experiences exist?</li>\n<li>Thomas Reid conceived cognition of external objects as made up of two aspects\n<ul>\n<li>Awareness of the object being perceived</li>\n<li>Belief in the existence of the object perceived</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The smell of a rose signifies both a sensation and a perception.</li>\n<li>Sensation is the conscious experience of the smell that we feel without any relation to the existence of an external object.</li>\n<li>Perception is the recognition of the presence of an object, the rose itself.</li>\n<li>Sensation represents a change in the state of the body, while perception involves representing external objects outside of the body.</li>\n<li>The distinction between sensation and perception goes unnoticed in ordinary life but becomes apparent in certain neurological conditions.</li>\n<li>E.g. Blindsight is impaired sensation but normal perception, while agnosia is impaired perception but normal sensation.</li>\n<li>Efference copy: every time the brain generates a command to move, a duplicate copy of the signal is sent to the sensory system.</li>\n<li>The brain uses the efference copy to compare between the expected and actual movement, a feedback mechanism to ensure correct movement.</li>\n<li>It’s likely that our phenomenal experience of the world may be closely related to the mechanisms we use to act upon it.</li>\n<li>The idea of an efference copy provides a general solution to a problem that all organisms face: that of disentangling otherwise identical sensory inputs generated by something happening to them (sensation) from those generated by something happening out there (perception).</li>\n<li>E.g. In earthworms, sudden stimulation of numerous receptors will cause a withdrawal reflex, yet if the worms crawl on their own there is no reflex. Thus, the worm nervous system must be distinguishing internally from externally generated stimulation.</li>\n<li>The efference copy provides the biological mechanism for the distinction between sensation and perception by tracking the origin of sensations.</li>\n<li>Since the organism can now distinguish itself from what happens to it and what happens out there, the organism can actively represent itself with respect to the outside.</li>\n<li>It’s only after the invention of the efferency copy, made necessary by the development of active locomotion, that the bodily reaction counts as a sensation, that it begins to feel.</li>\n<li>Time plays a critical role as the efference copy anticipates the arrival of the sensory signal so there’s no delay between prediction and sensation. If there’s no prediction, then the sensation comes as unexpected and thus external.</li>\n<li>We can inverse the idea of the efference copy, going from it predicting sensory stimulation as a result of movement to predicting motor consequences that follow from sensory activity.</li>\n<li>What we call feeling may be nothing more than the outcome of the comparison between the efference copy of the sensory/bodily response and the efference copy of a motor action.</li>\n</ul>","tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#navigation-related-structural-change-in-the-hippocampi-of-taxi-drivers\">Navigation-related structural change in the hippocampi of taxi drivers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#time-consciousness-the-missing-link-in-theories-of-consciousness\">Time consciousness: the missing link in theories of consciousness</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#fear-and-panic-in-humans-with-bilateral-amygdala-damage\">Fear and panic in humans with bilateral amygdala damage</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#visual-behaviour-mediated-by-retinal-projections-directed-to-the-auditory-pathway\">Visual behaviour mediated by retinal projections directed to the auditory pathway</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#visual-projections-routed-to-the-auditory-pathway-in-ferrets-receptive-fields-of-visual-neurons-in-primary-auditory-cortex\">Visual projections routed to the auditory pathway in ferrets: receptive fields of visual neurons in primary auditory cortex</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#hierarchical-organization-of-cortical-and-thalamic-connectivity\">Hierarchical organization of cortical and thalamic connectivity</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#neurogenesis-in-the-adult-human-hippocampus\">Neurogenesis in the adult human hippocampus</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#the-period-of-susceptibility-to-the-physiological-effects-of-unilateral-eye-closure-in-kittens\">The period of susceptibility to the physiological effects of unilateral eye closure in kittens</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#hard-criteria-for-empirical-theories-of-consciousness\">Hard criteria for empirical theories of consciousness</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#your-brain-is-not-an-onion-with-a-tiny-reptile-inside\">Your Brain Is Not an Onion With a Tiny Reptile Inside</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#life-without-a-brain-neuroradiological-and-behavioral-evidence-of-neuroplasticity-necessary-to-sustain-brain-function-in-the-face-of-severe-hydrocephalus\">Life without a brain: Neuroradiological and behavioral evidence of neuroplasticity necessary to sustain brain function in the face of severe hydrocephalus</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#theoretical-neuroscience-rising\">Theoretical Neuroscience Rising</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#are-there-levels-of-consciousness\">Are There Levels of Consciousness?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#the-hornswoggle-problem\">The hornswoggle problem</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#cellular-mechanisms-of-conscious-processing\">Cellular Mechanisms of Conscious Processing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#the-evolution-of-the-brain-the-human-nature-of-cortical-circuits-and-intellectual-creativity\">The evolution of the brain, the human nature of cortical circuits, and intellectual creativity</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#brain-behavior-and-mind-what-do-we-know-and-what-can-we-know\">Brain, Behavior, and Mind: What do we Know and What can we Know?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#the-control-of-neuron-number\">The Control of Neuron Number</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#reverse-engineering-the-mouse-brain\">Reverse engineering the mouse brain</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#the-rose-and-the-fly-a-conjecture-on-the-origin-of-consciousness\">The rose and the fly.
