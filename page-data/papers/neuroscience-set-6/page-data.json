When the monkey performs a precision grip and when it passively observes a precision grip performed by another agent.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Broadly congruent: respond during the execution of one action and during the observation of one or more similar, but not identical, actions.\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. Execution of a precision grip and observation of a power grip, precision grip, or related movement.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Logically related: respond to different actions in observe and execute conditions.\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. Experimenter placing food in front of the monkey and when the monkey grasps the food to eat.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Strictly and broadly congruent neurons were the primary interest of researchers and is what most researchers mean when we use the term “mirror neuron”.</li>\n<li>These cells are intriguing because, like a mirror, they respond and match observed and executed actions; they code both “my action” and “your action”.</li>\n<li>Monkey mirror neurons are responsive to the observation and execution of hand and mouth actions.</li>\n<li>Mirror neurons were originally found using single cell recording in the ventral premotor cortex and inferior parietal lobule on the monkey brain.</li>\n<li>Like monkey mirror neurons, we’ve found consistent evidence that human mirror neurons exist in both areas.</li>\n<li>Research using single-cell recording suggests that mirror neurons are typically present in adult human brains.</li>\n<li>Four possible functions of mirror neurons\n<ul>\n<li>Action understanding</li>\n<li>Speech perception</li>\n<li>Imitation</li>\n<li>Potential dysfunction in autism</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Action understanding\n<ul>\n<li>One summary analysis concluded that there was broad agreement that mirror neurons “plays some role in action process” but there’s no agreement on what that role might be.</li>\n<li>E.g. It could be low level such as movement execution or high level such as movement intention.</li>\n<li>Evidence suggests that mirror neurons encode concrete representations of observed actions; the lower levels of observed actions.</li>\n<li>However, any involvement doesn’t mean that mirror neurons play a causal role in action processing.</li>\n<li>A recent review concluded that there’s no compelling evidence for the involvement of mirror neurons or any mirror-neuron brain areas in higher level processes such as inferring other people’s intentions from their observed actions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Speech perception\n<ul>\n<li>Researchers agree that the motor system has some role in speech perception, but they disagree about the type and magnitude of the system’s role and whether mirror neurons are particularly important.</li>\n<li>While neuroimaging studies implicate the mirror-neuron brain areas in speech perception, evidence from patient studies contradict these findings.</li>\n<li>E.g. If speech perception requires perceived speech to be matched with motor commands for the production of speech, then one should find speech perception impairments in patients who have impairments in speech production due to brain lesions.</li>\n<li>This prediction is countered by a series of studies that showed intact speech sound discrimination in patients with speech production difficulties.</li>\n<li>There seems to be reasonably strong evidence for the involvement of the motor system in the discrimination of speech in perceptually noisy conditions, but this conclusion isn’t supported by patient data.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Imitation\n<ul>\n<li>This function received the strongest consensus among researchers due to two main findings.</li>\n<li>The first finding was that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the inferior frontal gyrus, a mirror-neuron brain area, selectively impairs imitative behavior.</li>\n<li>Causal methodologies, such as brain stimulation and patient studies, continue to support the consensus that mirror-neuron brain areas contribution to imitation.</li>\n<li>E.g. Stimulation of the inferior frontal gyrus demonstrated improvement in vocal imitation and naturalistic mimicry.</li>\n<li>Data from fMRI studies also support this function as we find greater responses in mirror-neuron brain areas during imitation compared to other closely matched tasks.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Autism\n<ul>\n<li>In contrast with imitation, researchers has huge disagreements on autism and mirror neurons.</li>\n<li>Broken-mirror theory: that people with autism have abnormal activity in mirror-neuron areas of the brain.</li>\n<li>A systematic review found little evidence for a global dysfunction of the mirror system in autistic people.</li>\n<li>Overall, past research has provided no compelling evidence for the claim that autism is associated with mirror-neuron dysfunction.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Do mirror neurons get their characteristic visual-motor matching properties from learning?</li>\n<li>One answer is that mirror neurons develop from the matching properties of standard sensorimotor associative learning.</li>\n<li>E.g. Mirror neurons start out as motor neurons but through correlated experiences of seeing and doing the same actions, these motor neurons become strongly connected to visual neurons tuned to similar actions.</li>\n<li>Another possibility is that there’s an innate or genetic predisposition to develop mirror neurons that’s independent of experience.</li>\n<li>More evidence has emerged arguing that learning plays an important role in the development of mirror neurons.</li>\n<li>E.g. Expert pianists and dancers had greater activity in mirror-neuron brain areas compared to observers who lacked such expertise.</li>\n<li>E.g. Wiggett et al. found using fMRI that mirror-neuron brain areas were more strongly activated by observation of hand movement sequences in participants who had simultaneously observed and executed the movements (sensorimotor learning) than in participants who had either observed the movements without performing them (sensory learning) or performed the movements without observing them (motor learning).</li>\n<li>The idea that motor learning alone is enough to change the properties of mirror neurons hasn’t been supported.</li>\n<li>It’s now well established that sensorimotor learning is important for the development of mirror neurons, but we don’t know the details of this learning.</li>\n<li>Two competing accounts of how mirror neurons develop\n<ul>\n<li>Associative account: maintains that the sensorimotor learning that builds mirror neurons is the same kind of learning that produces Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning.</li>\n<li>Canalization account: suggests that monkeys and humans genetically inherit a specific propensity to acquire mirror neurons.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Evidence is consistent with the associative account as mirror-neuron learning depends on standard conditioning such as contingency and contiguity.</li>\n<li>Recent studies have found no evidence of imitation in newborn monkeys and similar work in human neonates points in the same direction.</li>\n<li>Evidence doesn’t support the historical claim that newborns are capable of voluntary imitation of a range of action, and thus doesn’t support the canalization account.</li>\n<li>Reflection\n<ul>\n<li>On action understanding, evidence suggests that mirror-neuron brain areas contribute to low-level processing of observed actions but not directly to high-level action interpretation.</li>\n<li>On speech perception, the role of mirror neurons remains unclear.</li>\n<li>On imitation, we have strong evidence that mirror-neuron brain areas play a causal role in behavioral copying of body movement topography.</li>\n<li>On autism, we have no evidence for the broken-mirror theory.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>These findings are disappointing relative to early newspaper headlines.</li>\n<li>Possible reasons why mirror neurons became so popular\n<ul>\n<li>The deep historical pull of atomism, that objects are built out of units such as mirror neurons that combine sensory and motor properties, captivated people by the simple and tidy idea to explain complex ideas such as political strife and the social world.</li>\n<li>Some descriptions of mirror neurons imply telepathy or reading other’s minds.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The field studying mirror neurons has produced substantial findings which shouldn’t be dismissed just because mirror neurons are “the most hyped concept in neuroscience”.</li>\n<li>In the author’s view, much of the skepticism about mirror neurons is based on a misunderstanding.</li>\n<li>Humans are better imitators than other animals because sociocultural experience provides humans with matching sensorimotor experience for a broader range of actions.</li>\n<li>We need to think hard about why neurons have mirror properties.</li>\n<li>Mirror neurons contribute to complex control systems rather than dominating such systems or acting alone.</li>\n<li>Rather than being developed through genetics, mirror neurons acquire their properties through sensorimotor learning.</li>\n<li>Mirror neurons shouldn’t be tarnished and they have yet to fulfill their true promise.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2

conditioned stimuli drifted at a rate comparable to that of neutral odours.</li>\n<li>Thus, fear conditioning doesn’t appear to stabilize odour-evoked responses in piriform cortex as we observed stable behavior in spite of drifting neural activity.</li>\n<li>What’s the purpose of this representation drift?</li>\n<li>One hypothesis is that drift in piriform cortex may reflect a learning system that continuously updates and overwrite itself.</li>\n<li>Two supporting observations\n<ul>\n<li>The rate of drift of the evoked responses to familiar odorants was less than half that of unfamiliar odorants.</li>\n<li>Continual experience with an odorant enhances the stability of piriform cortex’s evoked responses to it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>It’s unlikely that the changes in odour-evoked responses observed here are caused by a failure to follow the same population of neurons.</li>\n<li>Once daily odour exposure ceased, evoked responses to the familiar and unfamiliar stimuli drifted at similar rates, thus, daily exposure slows representational drift.</li>\n<li>Regions downstream of piriform cortex could compensate for representational drift.</li>\n<li>E.g. Replay of previous odorants to regularly update the downstream region, exploiting some invariant geometry in odour-evoked population activity, or that the small subset of single units that did show preserved odour-evoked responses are responsible for encoding odour identity.</li>\n<li>Although we failed to uncover evidence for an invariant geometry, this doesn’t rule out the possibility of an invariant structure that lies on a nonlinear manifold.</li>\n<li>Piriform cortex may not be the ultimate arbiter of odour identity as other brain regions also receive olfactory sensory information.</li>\n<li>E.g. Anterior olfactory nucleus, olfactory tubercle, cortical amygdala, and lateral entorhinal cortex.</li>\n<li>Three main observations of this paper\n<ul>\n<li>Representational drift</li>\n<li>History-dependent stabilization</li>\n<li>Drift of previously stabilized odour-evoked responses</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>These observations are consistent with the model that the piriform cortex is a fast learning system that continually learns and continually overwrites itself.</li>\n<li>Lacking a mechanism to stabilize these memory traces, however, piriform cortex can’t store these memories for the long term.</li>\n<li>In this model, representational drift in piriform cortex is a consequence of continual learning and continual overwriting where learned representations may be transferred to a more stable region downstream for long-term storage.</li>\n<li>The stability of neural activity and representations varies across brain regions.</li>\n<li>E.g. In the hippocampus, representational drift is seen but in primary sensory regions, representational drift is limited.</li>\n<li>What conditions promote drifting versus stable neural activity?</li>\n<li>Maybe anatomical organization sets a bound on changes in stimulus tuning to basic features.</li>\n<li>E.g. In primary visual cortex, the weakening or loss of one synapse onto a visual cortical neuron is likely matched by the strengthening or gain of a synapse tuned to a similar retinotopic region, limiting representational drift.</li>\n<li>However, the organization of piriform cortex differs in that it receives distributed and unstructured inputs from olfactory bulb and there appears to be a lack of topographic organization.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"humans-can-discriminate-more-than-1-trillion-olfactory-stimuli\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#humans-can-discriminate-more-than-1-trillion-olfactory-stimuli\" aria-label=\"humans can discriminate more than 1 trillion olfactory stimuli permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1249168\">Humans Can Discriminate More than 1 Trillion Olfactory Stimuli</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Humans can discriminate between 2.3-7.5 million colors and around 340,000 tones, but the number of discriminable olfactory stimuli remains unknown.</li>\n<li>Using psychophysical testing, we calculated that humans can discriminate at least 1 trillion olfactory stimuli.</li>\n<li>This demonstrates that the human olfactory system, with its hundreds of different olfactory receptors, far outperforms the other senses in the number of physically different stimuli it can discriminate.</li>\n<li>To determine how many stimuli can be discriminated, we first must know the range and resolution of the sensory system.</li>\n<li>E.g.

those specific events occurred.</li>\n<li>This temporal context is crucial for distinguishing individual episodes.</li>\n<li>The discovery of timing signals in hippocampal neurons, time cells, strongly suggests that the hippocampus is important for tagging the time in episodic memories.</li>\n<li>This paper tests the hypothesis that the hippocampus is critical for keeping track of elapsed time over several minutes.</li>\n<li>We found that the hippocampus was essential for discriminating smaller, but not larger, temporal differences, consistent with a role in temporal pattern separation.</li>\n<li>This suggests that the hippocampus plays a critical role in remembering how long ago events occurred.</li>\n<li>Previous findings suggest that a fundamental role of the hippocampus is to provide an internal representation of elapsed time, which may support our capacity to remember the timing of individual events.</li>\n<li>However, this crucial link has yet to be shown.</li>\n<li>Basic timing ability is either normal or mildly impaired with hippocampal dysfunction.</li>\n<li>Uncovering the role of the hippocampus will require the use of longer (> 40s) timescales.</li>\n<li>We developed a novel behavioral paradigm to test the hypothesis that the hippocampus is critical for keeping track of elapsed time over several minutes.</li>\n<li>Methods\n<ul>\n<li>We trained rats to use odor-interval associations to indicate how much time has passed since a specific event.</li>\n<li>E.g. One odor for 1 minute, one for either 1.5/3/8 minutes, and one for 12 minutes.</li>\n<li>To determine the contribution of the hippocampus, we use localized infusions of fluorophore-conjugated muscimol (FCM) to temporarily inactivate the hippocampus.</li>\n<li>No notes on the detailed methods.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Fluorescence imaging confirmed that a large part of the rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampus was infused with FCM and very little FCM spread to other structures.</li>\n<li>This is evidence that the infusions were localized to the hippocampus, thus inactivating it.</li>\n<li>Interval conditions\n<ul>\n<li>1-3-12 min: finding show that discriminating intervals separated by large temporal differences don’t depend on the hippocampus and FCM infusions had no significant effect.</li>\n<li>1-8-12 min: FCM infusions significantly impaired performance for discriminating 8 vs 12 min trials while not impairing other trials, suggesting that the hippocampus is critical for discriminating small, but not large, temporal differences.</li>\n<li>1-1.5-12 min: FCM infusions significantly improved 1 vs 1.5 min trials, suggesting that hippocampal processing may be detrimental to the performance of fine temporal discriminations at seconds-long timescales.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

This is a problem because the brain can’t tell if the sensation is due to an external actor or due to our own movement.</li>\n<li>In this paper, we consider circuits for solving this problem in the primate brain. Circuits that convey a copy of each motor command, known as a corollary discharge (CD), to sensory brain regions solve this problem.</li>\n<li>E.g. In the visual system, CD signals help to produce a stable visual percept from the jumpy imaging resulting from our rapid eye movements.</li>\n<li>A possible pathway for providing CD for vision is from the superior colliculus to the frontal cortex.</li>\n<li>This circuit warns about impending eye movements used for planning subsequent movements and analyzing the visual world.</li>\n<li>A major function of nervous systems is to process sensory input to detect changes in the environment and act on those changes.</li>\n<li>E.g. A cat pouncing on a mouse requires it to ignore the sensation of grass brushing against its legs and to move its head and eyes to track the target.</li>\n<li>Moving any sensory organ to improve its detection ability, however, momentarily disrupts the very sense it’s intended to help.</li>\n<li>Nervous systems require a solution to these self-generated movement disruptions in sensation.</li>\n<li>One major mechanism is to provide warning signals to sensory systems from within the movement-generating systems themselves.</li>\n<li>The importance of motor-to-sensory feedback is seen if we imagine that they don’t exist.</li>\n<li>E.g. Moving a security camera causes the image to jerk, blurring the image during the time of movement.</li>\n<li>The fundamental difference between the security camera and the eye is internal feedback of movement information.</li>\n<li>This internal feedback, this warning signal, is the corollary discharge.</li>\n<li>Corollary discharge (CD): a copy of a motor command sent to brain areas for interpreting sensory inflow (also called efference copy).</li>\n<li>Efference: motor outflow that causes movements.</li>\n<li>Review of saccades (rapid eye movements).</li>\n<li>The saccadic network provides an attractive model system for studying the sources of CD and the pathways the distribute CD to sensory areas.</li>\n<li>Retina → V1 → Lateral intraparietal (LIP) → Frontal eye fields (FEF) → Superior colliculus (SC) → Midbrain and pontine reticular formation → Oculomotor nuclei that innervate each of the six eye muscles.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 843px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/CR4-DL/static/b7afa8c8dc005fd5def16fd4ce190087/4ff83/figure1-6.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 157.2%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Figure 1\"\n        title=\"Figure 1\"\n        src=\"/CR4-DL/static/b7afa8c8dc005fd5def16fd4ce190087/4ff83/figure1-6.png\"\n        srcset=\"/CR4-DL/static/b7afa8c8dc005fd5def16fd4ce190087/63868/figure1-6.png 250w,\n/CR4-DL/static/b7afa8c8dc005fd5def16fd4ce190087/0b533/figure1-6.png 500w,\n/CR4-DL/static/b7afa8c8dc005fd5def16fd4ce190087/4ff83/figure1-6.png 843w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 843px) 100vw, 843px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></li>\n<li>The parietal and frontal areas (LIP and FEF) contribute to the generation of voluntary saccades.</li>\n<li>What does a saccadic CD circuit look like?</li>\n<li>In theory, a CD pathway should run counter to the normal downward flow of sensorimotor processing.</li>\n<li>One such pathways is from the SC → Medial dorsal nucleus (MD) of the thalamus → FEF.</li>\n<li>It’s challenging to establish that a neuron carries CD as opposed to a movement command because by definition, both the command and CD should look the same.</li>\n<li>Four criteria for identifying CD\n<ul>\n<li>Must come from a brain region known to be involved in movement generation, but it must travel away from the muscles.</li>\n<li>The signal should occur just before the movement and represent its spatial and temporal parameters.</li>\n<li>The neurons shouldn’t contribute to producing the movement.</li>\n<li>Perturbing the CD pathway does disrupt performance on a task that depends on a CD.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Double-step task: when two targets are flashed sequentially and the subject has to make a saccade to the first target and then to the second.

Reflex behavior is explained by simple neural circuits.</li>\n<li>Organisms with fewer neurons can perform simple behaviors, while organisms with more neurons can have behavior that’s more flexible at a cost.</li>\n<li>The cost is choice: of selecting an action in a large repertoire of actions.</li>\n<li>The rich information we have about the world and the great number of options for behavior require appropriate attentional, decision-making, and coordinative functions.</li>\n<li>To deal with the overwhelming number of possibilities, we’ve evolved mechanisms that coordinate lower-level sensory and motor processes along a common theme: the internal goal.</li>\n<li>The ability for cognitive control is spread out over much of the brain, but we suspect that the PFC is particularly important.</li>\n<li>The PFC is most elaborated in primates, animals known for their diverse and flexible behavioral repertoire.</li>\n<li>The PFC is well positioned to coordinate a wide range of neural processes since it’s a collection of interconnected neocortical areas that sends and receives projections from virtually all cortical sensory, motor, and subcortical systems.</li>\n<li>However, an understanding of the mechanisms behind how the PFC executes control has remained elusive.</li>\n<li>This paper aims to provide a theory of PFC function that precisely defines its role in cognitive control.</li>\n<li>Role of PFC in top-down control of behavior\n<ul>\n<li>PFC isn’t critical for simple automatic behaviors (bottom-up).</li>\n<li>E.g. Balance or unexpected sounds.</li>\n<li>These hardwired pathways are important because they allow highly familiar behaviors to be executed quickly and automatically.</li>\n<li>However, the tradeoff is that these behaviors are inflexible and are stereotyped reactions caused by just the right stimulus.</li>\n<li>E.g. Hardwired behaviors don’t generalize well to novel situations and take extensive time and experience to develop.</li>\n<li>In contrast to these bottom-up pathways, the PFC is important when top-down processing is needed; when behavior must be guided by internal states or intentions.</li>\n<li>E.g. When we need to use the “rules of the game”; internal representations or goals and the means to achieve them.</li>\n<li>These pathways are weaker and change rapidly.</li>\n<li>Evidence\n<ul>\n<li>Stroop task and Wisconsin card sort task (WCST).</li>\n<li>E.g. Reading the word “GREEN” displayed in red.</li>\n<li>This conflict between the read word (“green), and the seen color (“red”) illustrates one of the most fundamental aspects of cognitive control and goal-directed behavior: the ability to select a weaker, task-relevant response in the face of competition from a stronger, but task-irrelevant one.</li>\n<li>Patients with frontal impairments have difficult with the Stroop task, especially when the instructions change frequently, suggesting that they have difficultly sticking with the goal of the task or its rules in the face of strong competition.</li>\n<li>We observe similar findings in the WCST.</li>\n<li>E.g.

The PFC must have access to and must influence a wide range of information in other brain regions; PFCs must have a high capacity for multimodality, integration, and plasticity.</li>\n<li>It must be possible to explain all of these properties without invoking some other mechanism of control, lest the theory become subject to problems of the hidden “homunculus”.</li>\n<li>This paper brings together various observations and arguments to show that a reasonably coherent, and mechanistically explicit, theory of PFC function is beginning to emerge.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Properties of the PFC\n<ul>\n<li>Convergence of diverse information\n<ul>\n<li>A system for cognitive control must have information about both the internal state of the system and the external state of the world.</li>\n<li>The PFC is anatomically well suited for this as it has interconnections with virtually all sensory and motor systems, and with limbic and midbrain structures involved in affect, memory, and reward.</li>\n<li>E.g. The lateral and dorsomedial PFC is more closely associated with sensory neocortex than the ventromedial PFC is with sensory neocortex.</li>\n<li>The PFC also has many intraconnections, which makes it suitable for coordinating and integrating these diverse signals.</li>\n<li>Many PFC areas receive converging inputs from at least two sensory modalities and in all cases, these inputs are from secondary/association and not from primary sensory cortex.</li>\n<li>Similarly, there are no direct connections between the PFC and primary motor cortex, but there are extensive connections with premotor areas that do project to primary motor cortex.</li>\n<li>Also important are the interconnections between the PFC and basal ganglia.</li>\n<li>The orbital and medial PFC are closely associated with medial temporal limbic structures critical for long-term memory and the processing of internal states.</li>\n<li>E.g. Direct and indirection connections with the hippocampus, amygdala, and hypothalamus.</li>\n<li>Most PFC regions are interconnected with most other PFC regions, providing pathways for information from diverse brain systems to interact.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Convergence and plasticity\n<ul>\n<li>Evidence suggests that lateral PFC neurons can convey the degree of association between a cue and a response.</li>\n<li>E.g. One neuron could show strong activation to one of two auditory cues, but only when the cue signaled a reward.</li>\n<li>More complicated behaviors between cues and responses/rewards may depend on more complex mappings.</li>\n<li>Neural responses to a given cue often depend on which rule is active in the task.</li>\n<li>Also, the baseline activity of many neurons varies with the rule.</li>\n<li>Lesion studies of the PFC also suggest that it’s used for learning rules.</li>\n<li>E.g. Following PFC damage, patients couldn’t learn arbitrary associations between visual patterns and hand gestures.</li>\n<li>Passingham argues that most, if not all, tasks that are disrupted following PFC damage depend on acquiring conditional associations (if-then rules).</li>\n<li>In sum, these results indicate that PFC neural activity represents the rules, or mappings, required to perform a particular task.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Feedback to other brain areas\n<ul>\n<li>Our theory requires the feedback signals from the PFC to reach widespread targets throughout the brain and we find that the PFC has the neural machinery to do so.</li>\n<li>E.g. Deactivating the lateral PFC attenuates the activity of visual cortical neurons to a behaviorally relevant cue.</li>\n<li>Neurons were found in the PFC that exhibited sustained sample-specific activity that survived the presentation of distractors, which wasn’t found for IT cortex.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Active maintenance\n<ul>\n<li>If the PFC represents the rules of a task in its pattern of neural activity, it must maintain this activity for as long as the rule is required.</li>\n<li>This capacity to support sustained activity in the face of interference is one of the distinguishing characteristics of the PFC.</li>\n<li>Many studies demonstrate that neurons within the PFC remain active during the delay between transiently presented cue and the later execution of a follow-up response.</li>\n<li>However, other areas of the brain also exhibit a simple form of sustained activity.</li>\n<li>E.g. In many cortical visual areas, a brief visual stimulus will evoke activity that persists from several hundred milliseconds to several seconds.</li>\n<li>The difference between the PFC and these other brain areas is that the PFC can sustain its activity in the face of distractions.</li>\n<li>E.g. In a visual matching task, the PFC sustains it’s activity while visual areas are easily disrupted by distractors.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Learning across time within the PFC\n<ul>\n<li>Rules often involve learning associations between stimuli and behaviors separated in time.</li>\n<li>How can associations learned for a rule/event at one point in time be used for behaviors/rewards at a later time?</li>\n<li>Even though a cue and action were separated in time, information about each was simultaneously present in the PFC, permitting an association to be formed between them.</li>\n<li>Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons may serve to reinforce patterns of PFC activity responsible for achieving a goal.</li>\n<li>As learning progresses, DA neurons become activated progressively earlier by events that predict reward and cease activation to the now-expected reward.</li>\n<li>However, if the predicted rewards fail to appear or appear sooner than expected, it will again elicit DA neural responses.</li>\n<li>Thus, midbrain DA neurons seem to be coding prediction error rather than reward, which is the degree that a reward is surprising.</li>\n<li>The goal of a cognitive system isn’t just to predict rewards but to also pursue actions that ensure its procurement.</li>\n<li>This prediction error signal could help in learning by selectively strengthening not only connections that predict reward, but also connections with representations in the PFC that guide the behavior needed to achieve it (downstream connections).</li>\n<li>Studies support this as damage to the PFC disrupts reward evaluation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Summary\n<ul>\n<li>The review of studies here show that the PFC exhibits the properties required to support cognitive control.</li>\n<li>E.g. Sustained activity robust to distractions/interference, multimodal convergence and integration, feedback pathways to exert influence on other brain structures, and ongoing plasticity that’s adaptive to the demands of new tasks.</li>\n<li>While these properties aren’t unique to the PFC and are found in other brain areas, we argue that the PFC represents a specialization along this specific combination of dimensions that’s optimal for a role in brain-wide control and coordination.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Activation theory of PFC function\n<ul>\n<li>A simple model of PFC function\n<ul>\n<li>Most neural network models of PFC simulate it as the activation of a set of rule units whose activation leads to the production of a response other than the one most strongly associated with a given input.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 849px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/CR4-DL/static/edaf349988eaa70ada01d7473ffa35f1/f96df/figure4-8.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 157.6%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAgCAIAAACdAM/hAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAADPklEQVR42pVVbZPaOAzm//+Wu70vu/1wMzfX3WHbuwKF6dIlEIhfZNkOIUtwXhwgCR0nbT906bBokokV6ZHkR4rTO52TfVluNhtEZJQBwPF4POvW+0Wv6zrZ7aRSQkhry6ZphBDz+Xy9XjdNcwGcZRklZPb89OH+HQ2WaZp9Ho3G47HnedbaC+CmaaqqkoiP/YfHfn+xWHx9nnmeV9d1VVUXwA5f13H84s2+3tzc3Pz5x+PDP3med3HfAG6aOH4JVn6o9XA4eJoMXsN+C+5o01pFUTSZTIIgOP1GzmU+nTZhOP6/v+SMBsF4+OGKsuu6ligzk2ZZVpYWAIwxbwWfTidbFEmSpGl2LPOjTa/b82sKrwAbY7bbrVJKay2EuGLPVVUnyW6ziY1J8zzXOgSA1xNyBmytJYQ8TyeMkiRJjlU1/TL+PBrO5/OyLC+AiyKXUn0ZPQwH/3mz2XodjQYfR8NBuF5fBneSpvl0Or29vb27u5vPF2EYXtHnMIzGn/59d/vX+/f3/fu/i6L4MT5vyHysqs0m1kr5vr9ard56GHTxM7N7Gn9acerNZuPhx7K0V/RZSQmMrOPN9uXF9xdJklwxnsaYLC+Koqiqo0131hbnMxuTWVseDgdry3LvpH0ettvtNknyLCvzdL8/ONPh4G4nx7L17XmeRymjlPq+zxhjnDPGVqsVIUQIwTkwDkFAOOeEEN/3CaGISAmllPbCMJRKAYCUUis3yUpr5U5PRJRaawDgnAMI6UQ5BzfzIaLsMcaFQK01pUwIFK0gym7hKuEcEZfLpSvLBQJEJCTgHHqijUwp5ZzHcWwdTcVutzPG5Hmepu5IsNY6Cr8vUlsUeZ4bY3rtn0EiSqWUlO4KwxDAZQcQYbgWiFHkfKRz0YxxqbVATJKkByA444RQIYRWOggCVyjjUkrnJxEAUGBXGqUsCALGOXBQSvcQ3T6BAwC0n75L2NoUuvQtb0o58pRuA4muRkR0hBFCKePCkeQ8KW2pEYK5PvGWPGeSUlHG21468pkjTIhQa85Y22cqABilQgAlBDhHIUgQUEqllG69CjoV3QhwB46iaL/fF0XRzY219qdatmr35vDDVH4fxf03YWYSHvE9tGcAAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Figure 4\"\n        title=\"Figure 4\"\n        src=\"/CR4-DL/static/edaf349988eaa70ada01d7473ffa35f1/f96df/figure4-8.png\"\n        srcset=\"/CR4-DL/static/edaf349988eaa70ada01d7473ffa35f1/63868/figure4-8.png 250w,\n/CR4-DL/static/edaf349988eaa70ada01d7473ffa35f1/0b533/figure4-8.png 500w,\n/CR4-DL/static/edaf349988eaa70ada01d7473ffa35f1/f96df/figure4-8.png 849w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 849px) 100vw, 849px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></li>\n<li>Connections along a pathway are stronger as a consequence of more extensive and consistent use.</li>\n<li>The ability to engage weaker pathways requires adding a set of control units connected to stimulus features.</li>\n<li>We assume the control units in the model to represent the function of neurons in the PFC.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Guided activation as a mechanism of cognitive control\n<ul>\n<li>Our model emphasizes that the role of the PFC is modulatory rather than transmissive.</li>\n<li>E.g. Information doesn’t run through the PFC but is instead guided by it along task-relevant pathways.</li>\n<li>An analogy is that the PFC functions like a switch operator for a system of railroad tracks.</li>\n<li>E.g. The brain is a set of tracks (pathways) connecting various origins (stimuli) to destinations (responses). The goal is to get the trains (activity carrying information) at each origin to their proper destination as efficiently as possible while avoiding collisions. If there’s only one train, no intervention is needed. However, if two trains must cross the same track, then some coordination is needed to guide them safely to their destination.</li>\n<li>Patterns of PFC activity can be thought of as a map that specifies which pattern of tracks is needed to solve the task, and this is achieved by biasing signals from the PFC.</li>\n<li>This distinction between modulation vs transmission is consistent with neuropsychological deficits associated with frontal lobe damage.</li>\n<li>E.g. One patient prepared coffee by first stirring then adding cream when the correct order is cream first then stir. The actions still occurred as transmission was intact but the order was incorrect as modulation was impaired.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Active maintenance in the service of control\n<ul>\n<li>Sustained activity can be viewed as a mechanism of control.</li>\n<li>Weaker pathways rely more on top-down support when faced with competition from a stronger pathway.</li>\n<li>This suggests that increased demand for control requires greater or longer PFC activation, which is what we see in the neuroimaging literature.</li>\n<li>This also explains the reverse case where as a task becomes more practiced, its reliance on control is reduced.</li>\n<li>From a neural perspective, as a pathway is repeatedly selected by PFC bias signals, activity-dependent plasticity mechanisms can strengthen them.</li>\n<li>With strengthening, these circuits can function independently of the PFC and performance becomes more automatic.</li>\n<li>This aligns with studies showing that PFC damage impairs learning while sparing well-practiced tasks.</li>\n<li>Selective attention and behavioral inhibition are two sides of the same coin.</li>\n<li>Attention is the effect of biasing competition in favor of task-relevant information, and inhibition is the consequence for task-irrelevant information.</li>\n<li>We should distinguish between the activity-dependent control of the PFC with other forms of control such as the hippocampal system.</li>\n<li>E.g. The hippocampus lays down new tracks while the PFC is responsible for flexibly switching between them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Updating of PFC representations\n<ul>\n<li>It’s easier, faster, and cheaper to switch between existing tracks than it is to lay new ones down.</li>\n<li>Representations in the PFC face two competing demands: they must be responsive to relevant changes in the environment (adaptive) but they must also be resistant to irrelevant changes (robust).</li>\n<li>Studies support this as PFC representations are responsive to task-relevant stimuli yet are robust to interference from distractors.</li>\n<li>Damage to the PFC further supports this as two hallmarks of PFC damage are perseverations (inadequate updating) and increased distractibility (inappropriate updating).</li>\n<li>DA neurons may play a role in implementing this as it’s been suggested that they provide a time-sensitive gating mechanism.</li>\n<li>Timing is important because updates must match the conditions.</li>\n<li>DA neurons may learn when to gate through feedback.</li>\n<li>E.g. If an exploratory DA-mediated gating signal leads to successful behavior, then its coincident reinforcing effects will strengthen both the DA signal and thus the behavior signal.</li>\n<li>This bootstrapping mechanism may be how the PFC self-organizes, which averts the problem of how the DA-signals are controlled in the first place, avoiding a theoretical regress aka recursion.</li>\n<li>E.g. If the PFC controls behavior and DA signals control the PFC, how are DA signals controlled?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Issues\n<ul>\n<li>Representational power of the PFC\n<ul>\n<li>The tremendous range of tasks that people are capable of raises important questions about the ability of the PFC to support the necessary range of representations.</li>\n<li>The large size of the PFC (over 30% of cortical mass) suggests that it can support a wide range of mappings.</li>\n<li>However, there seems to be an infinite number of tasks that a person can do and it seems unlikely that all possible mappings are represented within the PFC.</li>\n<li>E.g. “Wink whenever I say bumblydoodle.”</li>\n<li>Perhaps some undiscovered representational scheme can support this infinite flexibility of human behavior.</li>\n<li>Or maybe plasticity can account for PFC flexibility.</li>\n<li>As of this paper, we don’t know yet the mechanisms behind the wide and extraordinary flexibility of human behavior.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>PFC functional organization\n<ul>\n<li>How are PFC representations organized?</li>\n<li>Maybe each PFC region handles a different function or that each region has the same function but operates on different types of information/representations.</li>\n<li>Our theory suggests that it’s unlikely that different classes of information will be represented in a modular or discrete form.</li>\n<li>E.g. Most regions of the PFC can respond to a variety of different types of information.</li>\n<li>The PFC may also be organized topographically with each stimulus dimension handled in a different region with some regions being multimodal.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Monitoring and allocation of control\n<ul>\n<li>A stronger pattern of activity within the PFC produces stronger biasing effects for a certain pathway, which may be at the expense of other pathways though competition.</li>\n<li>Recent studies suggest that allocation of control may depend on signals from the anterior cingulate cortex.</li>\n<li>E.g. Two trains destined to cross tracks at the same time or the coactivation of competing (mutually inhibiting) sets of units such as both “red” and “green” in the Stroop task.</li>\n<li>Such conflict produces uncertainty in processing and increases the chance of errors.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Mechanisms of active maintenance\n<ul>\n<li>There’s little empirical research on the mechanisms responsible for sustained activity.</li>\n<li>Two possible mechanisms: cellular models that propose neuron bistability and circuit models that propose the recirculation of activity through closed/recurrent loops of neurons.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Capacity limits of control\n<ul>\n<li>One of the most perplexing properties of cognitive control is its severely limited capacity.</li>\n<li>E.g.

A SAC dendrite is more strongly activated by motion outward (from soma to dendrite) than by motion in the opposite direction. Thus, outward motion is this SAC dendrite’s preferred direction.</li>\n<li>Note that it’s incorrect to say a SAC has a preferred direction because each of the SAC’s dendrites has its own preferred direction.</li>\n<li>Since DS remains after blocking inhibitory synaptic transmission, the only remaining inputs to SACs are BCs, which are excitatory.</li>\n<li>Thus, DS seems to emerge from the BC-SAC circuit.</li>\n<li>Motion is a spatiotemporal phenomenon as an object at one location appears at another location after a time delay.</li>\n<li>We propose that the proximal BCs (wired near the SAC soma) lag the distal BCs (wired far from the soma), which leads to DS.</li>\n<li>E.g.

A classical connectionist might propose that the program is a set of synaptic weights and that some process changes these weights.</li>\n<li>However, synaptic weights aren’t the only programmable elements in the brain.</li>\n<li>E.g. Death and creation of neurons, death and creation of synapses, position of axons on dendrites.</li>\n<li>Thus, the brain isn’t a dualistic entity that a computer is so it isn’t a fact that brains are computers.</li>\n<li>Is the brain-computer idea an analogy or metaphor?</li>\n<li>The distinction is that an analogy is explicit while a metaphor is implicit.</li>\n<li>Metaphors can be powerful intellectual tools because they transport familiar concepts into an unfamiliar domain.</li>\n<li>E.g. The brain-computer metaphor bridges mental and physiological domains.</li>\n<li>It’s no wonder that computers offer a natural way to describe how the brain implements cognitions: computers were designed with human cognition in mind in the first place.</li>\n<li>E.g. The term “computer memory” comes from human memory.</li>\n<li>What do we mean when we say that the brain implements algorithms? And is this true?</li>\n<li>Algorithm: a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output.</li>\n<li>An algorithm must be a procedure that’s reducible to a finite set of elementary operations applied in a specific order.</li>\n<li>E.g. The solar system isn’t an algorithm because the motion of planets can’t be decomposed into a finite set of operations. Gravitational laws model a planet’s motion, not an algorithm.</li>\n<li>In the same way, a model of brain function isn’t necessarily an algorithm.</li>\n<li>E.g. Deep learning models are an algorithm, but the Hodgkin-Huxley model isn’t.</li>\n<li>The Hodgkin-Huxley model can be simulated by an algorithm, but the fact that a relationship between two measurable variables is computable doesn’t imply that the physical system actually implements an algorithm to map one variable to the other.</li>\n<li>A less misleading term is “computation”.</li>\n<li>The brain might not be a computer because it isn’t programmable and doesn’t run algorithms, but it certainly computes.</li>\n<li>E.g. The brain can transform sound waves captured by the ears into the spatial position of a sound source.</li>\n<li>What is meant by computation in the brain is tricky.</li>\n<li>E.g. Is computation the transformation of acoustic signals into some neural activity that can be used to identify the source position? Is computation the transformation from sensory signals to some mental entity that represents source position?</li>\n<li>The difference between computation and transformation is that the output is a representation and not just a value.</li>\n<li>But then we need to explain what representation means in this context.</li>\n<li>So, it isn’t obvious in what sense the brain “computes” if it does.</li>\n<li>Brain processes are often described using words borrowed from the lexical field of computers, but this is a double metaphor because computers are themselves metaphorically described with mental terms.</li>\n<li>This circular metaphorical relationship explains why the metaphor is misleadingly appealing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"metabolic-rate-and-body-size-are-linked-with-perception-of-temporal-information\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#metabolic-rate-and-body-size-are-linked-with-perception-of-temporal-information\" aria-label=\"metabolic rate and body size are linked with perception of temporal information permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.06.018\">Metabolic rate and body size are linked with perception of temporal information</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The effect of body size and metabolic rate on the resolution that temporal information is perceived hasn’t been studied.</li>\n<li>As both smaller size and higher metabolic rates facilitate rapid behavioral responses, we hypothesized that these traits would favour perception of temporal change over finer timescales.</li>\n<li>We used the critical flicker fusion frequency to measure the maximum rate of temporal information processing in the visual system.</li>\n<li>Critical flicker fusion frequency: the lowest frequency of flashing at which a flickering light source is perceived as constant.</li>\n<li>All biological systems are shaped by universal constraints.</li>\n<li>E.g.

In the tiger beetle, the relatively low temporal resolution of its visual system causes it to take a stop-start approach to recalibrate the position of its prey when hunting.</li>\n<li>E.g. In humans, the limitations of our temporal perception are apparent when tracking fast-moving objects such as a soccer ball or badminton birdie.</li>\n<li>Two intrinsic factors that may shape the temporal resolution tradeoff are body size and metabolic rate.</li>\n<li>As body size increases, manoeuvrability decreases. As metabolic rate increases, both manoeuvrability and the physiological ability to process information increases.</li>\n<li>We hypothesize that smaller organisms and those with higher metabolic rates perceive temporal change on finer timescales.</li>\n<li>To quantify the temporal perceptual abilities of a range of species, we use the fact that neural firing in the visual system is all-or-none.</li>\n<li>This binary firing must encode temporal resolution in discrete units as biological visual systems must discretize the continuous-time and continuous-space information reaching the retina and then integrate this information over time.</li>\n<li>This integration time of visual systems can be quantified using the critical flicker fusion frequency (CFF), the lowest frequency of flashing at which a flickering light source is perceived as constant.</li>\n<li>The maximum CFF value can be used as a proxy for the temporal resolution of the sensory system.</li>\n<li>We used the CFF to compare the temporal resolution of the visual system in a wide range of vertebrate species, testing whether the temporal resolution of the sensory system increases with mass-specific metabolic rate and decreases with body mass.</li>\n<li>In behavioral studies, CFF is measured through conditional training with the subject trained to respond to a change in its perception of a light flashing.</li>\n<li>In electroretinogram (ERG) studies, a direct measurement of the electrical response of the retina in reaction to a flashing light source is used as a measure of CFF.</li>\n<li>No notes on the method.</li>\n<li>According to our model, small animals with high mass-specific metabolic rates in high light environments possessed the highest maximum CFF and hence the greatest ability to perceive temporally dynamic visual information.</li>\n<li>Conversely, large animals with low mass-specific metabolic rates in low light environments had the lowest CFF.\n<span\n

href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn.2016.167\">Scanning the horizon: towards transparent and reproducible neuroimaging research</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Concerns have recently been raised that the conclusions drawn from some human neuroimaging studies are either spurious or not generalizable.</li>\n<li>This paper discusses problems related to neuroimaging, outlines current and suggested best practices, and describes how we think the field should evolve to produce the most meaningful and reliable answers to neuroscientific questions.</li>\n<li>Neuroimaging, specifically functional MRI (fMRI) has become a powerful tool to learn about the brain.</li>\n<li>The most common form of fMRI, BOLD fMRI, measures brain activity indirectly through localized changes in blood oxygenation that occur in relation to synaptic signalling.</li>\n<li>These changes in signal provide the ability to map activation to specific mental processes, to identify functionally connected networks, to characterize neural representational spaces, and to decode or predict mental function from brain activity.</li>\n<li>The high dimensionality of fMRI data, the relatively low power of most fMRI studies, and the great amount of flexibility in data analysis all contribute to the potentially high degree of false-positive findings.</li>\n<li>Recent years have seen intense interest in the reproducibility of scientific results.</li>\n<li>We outline here a number of potentially problematic research practices in neuroimaging that can lead to increased risk of false or exaggerated results.</li>\n<li>The field of genetics has dealt with a similar problem and solved it by using large-scale collaboration and data sharing by the genetics community.</li>\n<li>Low statistical power\n<ul>\n<li>Low power not only reduces the likelihood of finding true positives, but it also raises the likelihood of false positives.</li>\n<li>Sample sizes have steadily increased over the past two decades of fMRI research with the median sample size estimated for a single-group fMRI study in 2015 at 28.5.</li>\n<li>The typical effect sizes observed in task-related BOLD imaging studies fall considerably below the minimum required level.</li>\n<li>The average fMRI study remains poorly powered for capturing realistic effects.</li>\n<li>The solution is that all sample sizes should be justified by an a priori power analysis.</li>\n<li>When previous data aren’t available to support a power analysis, one can instead identify the sample size that would support finding the minimum effect size that would be informative.</li>\n<li>We don’t believe that the solution is to admit weakly powered studies simply on the basis that the researchers lacked the resources to use a larger sample.</li>\n<li>The field of genetics dealt with a similar problem more than a decade ago as weakly powered genetic association studies were unreliable.</li>\n<li>The field then moved to using much larger samples with high power to detect even very small associations and began to enforce replication.</li>\n<li>In cases where more data can’t be gathered, there are three options to improve power.</li>\n<li>First is to collect more data from each individual and present results at the individual level rather than at the group level, although results can’t be generalized.</li>\n<li>Second is to use more-liberal statistical thresholding procedures such as false discovery rate (FDR) at the expense of more false-positive results.</li>\n<li>Third is to restrict the search space using a small number of a priori ROIs or an independent functional localizer to identify specific ROIs for each individual.</li>\n<li>HARKing: hypothesizing after results are known.</li>\n<li>We also note that Bayesian methods can make the best use of small, underpowered samples.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Flexibility and exploration in data analysis\n<ul>\n<li>Submitting the same data to different fMRI analysis workflows can result in different statistical maps.</li>\n<li>These “researcher degrees of freedom” can lead to substantial inflation of type I error rates.</li>\n<li>Exploration is key to scientific discovery but rarely does a research paper comprehensively describe the actual process of exploration because it would make the narrative too complex.</li>\n<li>Instead, reports may engage in HARKing because it hides the number of data-driven choices made during analysis, thus leading to potentially overstated evidence for a hypothesis.</li>\n<li>The solution is to pre-register the methods and analysis plans.</li>\n<li>E.g. Planned sample size, specific analysis tools to be used, predicted outcomes, and definition of any specific ROIs.</li>\n<li>Exploratory analyses should be clearly distinguished from planned analyses in the publication.</li>\n<li>We don’t believe the solution is to constrain researchers by specifying which particular methods should be used because many of the most interesting findings in fMRI have come from the use of novel analysis methods.</li>\n<li>We also don’t believe that there’s a single best workflow for all studies.</li>\n<li>We believe that the best solution is to allow flexibility but require that all exploratory analyses be clearly labelled as such and encourage validation of exploratory results.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Multiple comparisons\n<ul>\n<li>The most common approach to neuroimaging analysis involves mass univariate testing where a hypothesis test is performed for each voxel.</li>\n<li>This approach leads to inflated false positives if there’s no correction for multiple tests.</li>\n<li>Whether multiple-comparison correction is too liberal or too conservative, the deeper problem is the inconsistent application of correction approaches.</li>\n<li>E.g. Many researchers freely combine different approaches and thresholds in ways that produce a high number of undocumented research degrees of freedom, rendering reported p-values uninterpretable.</li>\n<li>Sadly, whereas non-parametric methods such as permutation tests are known to provide more accurate control over FWE rates than do parametric methods and are applicable for nearly all models, they weren’t commonly used.</li>\n<li>The solution to balancing type I and type II error rates is to use a dual approach of reporting corrected whole-brain results and sharing the unthresholded statistical map.</li>\n<li>Any use of non-standard methods for correction of multiple comparisons should be explicitly justified.</li>\n<li>Another solution is to abandon the mass univariate approach altogether but this raises other interpretation issues.</li>\n<li>E.g. Multivariate methods that treat the entire brain as the measurement and graph-based approaches that integrate information over all edges.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Software errors\n<ul>\n<li>As software programs increase in complexity, bugs are more likely.</li>\n<li>E.g. The software used for fMRI analysis is likely to contain bugs.</li>\n<li>Most fMRI researchers use one of several open-source analysis packages for preprocessing and statistical analyses with additional analyses requiring custom programs.</li>\n<li>Because most researchers writing custom code aren’t trained in software engineering, there’s insufficient attention to good software-development practices that could catch and prevent errors and bugs.</li>\n<li>One solution is that researcher should avoid writing custom code when the problem can be solved using software tools from a well-established project.</li>\n<li>Errors are more likely to be discovered when code has a larger user base and follows better development practices.</li>\n<li>Researchers should learn and implement software testing and validation.</li>\n<li>Custom analysis code should always be shared on manuscript submission and shared to the public.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Insufficient study reporting\n<ul>\n<li>Unfortunately, reporting standards in the fMRI literature remain poor.</li>\n<li>E.g. In some papers, it was impossible to identify which multiple-comparison correction technique was used.</li>\n<li>Claims in the neuroimaging literature are often asserted without corresponding statistical support.</li>\n<li>E.g. Failure to observe a statistically significant effect can lead researchers to claim the absence of an effect.</li>\n<li>The difference between “significant” and “not significant” is not itself statistically significant.</li>\n<li>One solution is for authors to follow accepted standards for reporting methods and journals should require adherence to these standards.</li>\n<li>Every major claim in a paper should be directly supported by appropriate statistical evidence.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Lack of independent replications\n<ul>\n<li>Surprisingly, there are few examples of direct replication in the field of neuroimaging and the replicability of neuroimaging findings is exceedingly low.</li>\n<li>One cause of this is because the academic community tends to put greater emphasis on novelty of findings rather than on their replicability.</li>\n<li>The solution is for the community to acknowledge replication reports as scientifically important research outcomes that are essential in advancing knowledge.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Towards the neuroimaging paper of the future\n<ul>\n<li>Here we outline what we would like to see in the neuroimaging paper of the future.</li>\n<li>Planning\n<ul>\n<li>Sample size is predetermined using formal statistical power analysis.</li>\n<li>The entire analysis plan and specific definitions are formally pre-registered.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Implementation\n<ul>\n<li>All code for data collection and analysis is stored in a version-control system and made public.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Validation\n<ul>\n<li>All exploratory results validated against an independent validation data set.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Dissemination\n<ul>\n<li>All results clearly marked as either hypothesis-driven or exploratory.</li>\n<li>All analyses performed are reported.</li>\n<li>The data necessary to reproduce the analyses are public.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Given the substantial amount of research funds that are currently invested in neuroimaging research, we believe that it’s essential that the field address the issues raised here to ensure that public funds are spent effectively and in ways that advance our understanding of the human brain.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"single-units-and-sensation-a-neuron-doctrine-for-perceptual-psychology\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#single-units-and-sensation-a-neuron-doctrine-for-perceptual-psychology\" aria-label=\"single units and sensation a neuron doctrine for perceptual psychology permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1068%2Fp010371\">Single Units and Sensation: A Neuron Doctrine for Perceptual Psychology?</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>This paper discusses the relationship between the firing of single neurons in sensory pathways and subjectively experienced sensations.</li>\n<li>Five dogmas/principles\n<ol>\n<li>To understand nervous function, we need to look at interactions at a cellular level because behavior depends upon the organized pattern of these intercellular interactions.</li>\n<li>The sensory system is organized to achieve as complete a representation of the sensory stimulus as possible with the minimum number of active neurons.</li>\n<li>Trigger features (stimuli) of sensory neurons are matched to redundant patterns of stimulation by experience and by developmental processes.</li>\n<li>Perception corresponds to the activity from a small selection of very high-level neurons, each of which corresponds to a pattern of external events.</li>\n<li>High impulse frequency in such neurons corresponds to high certainty that the stimulus is present.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Recordings from single neurons in sensory pathways tell us something important about how we sense the world, but what exactly have we been told?</li>\n<li>The main argument is that our perceptions are caused by the activity of a small number of neurons selected from a very large population of predominantly silent cells.</li>\n<li>Perception results from the mechanisms determining when a single cell becomes active.</li>\n<li>Recording from single neurons\n<ul>\n<li>In the 1920s and 1930s, Adrian and his colleagues recorded the all-or-none impulses of single nerve fibers connecting the sense organs to the brain.</li>\n<li>They showed that each fiber coming from the skin responded to a particular type of stimulus applied to a specific region (receptive field).</li>\n<li>E.g. Pressure, temperature, damage.</li>\n<li>The frequency of the impulses depended on the intensity of the stimulus, but it was clear that the character/type of the sensation (touch, heat, or pain) depended on the fiber carrying the message and not the message itself, since this consisted of trains of similar impulses in all fibers.</li>\n<li>Nerves link physical stimuli to sensation and these results provided evidence for that link.</li>\n<li>Muller’s doctrine of specific nerve energies: that the specificity of different sensations stems from the responsiveness of different nerve fibers to different types of stimuli.</li>\n<li>The chemical senses proved to be a little different, but all sensations still follow this doctrine.</li>\n<li>Sensory nerves usually adapt to a constant stimulus and therefore signal sudden changes of stimuli energy better than sustained levels.</li>\n<li>Neighboring receptive fields and modalities were also known to overlap, but when the activity of neurons at higher levels in sensory pathways were recorded, it became obvious that something was happening that was more complex and significant than could fit with the idea of simple mapping with overlap and adaptation.</li>\n<li>Review of lateral inhibition in retinal ganglion cells and “bug detector” cells in frogs.</li>\n<li>This result makes one realize that a large part of the sensory machinery involved in a frog’s feeding responses may actually reside in the retina rather than in mysterious brain centres.</li>\n<li>The lock-like property in each class of neurons only allows the cell to discharge when the appropriate key pattern of sensory stimulation is given.</li>\n<li>We called these key patterns “trigger features” or “sensory/stimulus features”.</li>\n<li>Just as light is only an intermediate agent allowing a retinal ganglion cell to detect its trigger feature, so too are the optic nerve impulses acting as intermediate agents enabling the higher centres of the brain to perform their tasks.</li>\n<li>Two important concepts from the frog’s retina\n<ul>\n<li>It transmits a map not of light intensities, but of the trigger features in the world.</li>\n<li>It’s main function isn’t to transduce different luminance levels into different impulse frequencies, but to continue responding invariantly to the same external patterns despite changes of average luminance.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Review of Hubel and Wiesel’s simple and complex cells in the visual cortex.</li>\n<li>This work provided the idea of hierarchical organization in the brain and provided evidence for a new type of invariance.</li>\n<li>E.g. In the cat and frog, the retina is mainly responsible for ensuring that messages sent to the brain aren’t perturbed by changes in ambient illumination. The higher level neurons in the brain respond to the same trigger features but over a larger range of positions.</li>\n<li>The modality specificity of peripheral neurons indicates how one can detect where a sensation comes from.</li>\n<li>E.g. Where warmth is at any point on the body surface.</li>\n<li>We now see that the organized pattern specificity of a set of cortical neurons can, in the same way, produce positional invariance for pattern perception.</li>\n<li>Although we don’t understand how recognition is invariant for position, size, and perspective transformations, at least we have a starting point.</li>\n<li>Later experiments showed that the primary neurons of the visual cortex are more specific, in one aspect, than Hubel and Wiesel originally thought.</li>\n<li>Review of ipsi- and contra-lateral eye dominant neurons and how they’re used to judge distance.</li>\n<li>In uncovering this aspect of the pattern selectivity of sensory neurons, we again get the sense that a central neuron is reaching out to discover something important about what’s happening in the real world.</li>\n<li>Perhaps the line and edge detectors in the brain aren’t just for identifying objects, but also for determining the object’s distance from the animal.</li>\n<li>As in the case of the frog’s bug detector, the importance of the information abstracted from the retinal images gives some insight into the purpose or direction of the physiological mechanisms.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Single units and psychophysics\n<ul>\n<li>We should concentrate on the informational flow rather than on the direct subjective-physiological comparison.</li>\n<li>E.g. Information discarded in a peripheral stage of processing can’t be accurately added back centrally.</li>\n<li>E.g. Instead of “signalling spatial contrast” for lateral inhibition, it’s more useful to describe it as “attenuating low spatial frequencies”.</li>\n<li>We find the same when we study color.</li>\n<li>E.g. Hue/color discrimination as a function of wavelength served by red-green and blue-yellow opponent systems.</li>\n<li>The concept that neurophysiology and sensation are best linked by looking at the flow of information rather than simpler measures of neuronal activity.</li>\n<li>As with color, Mountcastle and colleagues established that the sensory response depends simply on the category of nerve fiber with the lowest threshold.</li>\n<li>It’s as if the screen on which sensations appear is completely blank until a sensory pathway is activated, lighting up a point and becoming instantly visible.</li>\n<li>This isn’t what we would expect if there was a lot of ongoing activity in all pathways or if the magnitude of the signal was a linear function of intensity or if sensation depended, in a complex combinatorial way, upon the activity of many units.</li>\n<li>Rather, this suggests that the magnitude of the signal directly represents the signal-to-noise ratio so that insignificant signals are automatically small and the neuron firing the most is automatically the most sensitive.</li>\n<li>Both peripheral and central neurons have a decreased response when the stimuli/pattern is sustained or repeatedly presented.</li>\n<li>E.g. Adaptation, habituation, or fatigue.</li>\n<li>If sensory messages are given a significance proportional to their informational value, mechanisms must exist for reducing the representation of patterns that are constantly present, and this is presumably the underlying reason for adaptive effects.</li>\n<li>It was commonly thought that neurons were unreliable elements perturbed by metabolic or random disturbances and that the high degree of reliability the nervous system achieves was because the supposed redundancy of neural circuits and appropriate rules for averaging and combing them.</li>\n<li>However, developments in the study of human vision at the absolute threshold and absolute sensitivity of retinal ganglion cells now indicate that neurons aren’t intrinsically unreliable and that noise often originates externally.</li>\n<li>Noise may always be present, but to an amazing extent it comes from outside the nervous system.</li>\n<li>We now realize that a neuron’s erratic behavior was caused by our ignorance and not the neuron’s incompetence.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Modifiability of cortical neurons\n<ul>\n<li>Review of sensitive and critical periods in the cat visual cortex as discovered by Hubel and Wiesel.</li>\n<li>How does experience modify selectivity?</li>\n<li>In all cases, animals whose visual experience was experimentally modified lacks neurons responsive to the features excluded by the experiment, which are found in normal animals.</li>\n<li>E.g. Unilateral eyelid suture lead to a cortex with very few neurons excitable from the sutured eye. Strabismus or lazy eye decreased the proportion of neurons responding to both eyes.</li>\n<li>The rule holds that neurons are found for patterns of excitation that occur in the modified environment, but normally occurring types of selectivity are rare or absent if the patterns they would respond to haven’t been experienced in the modified environment.</li>\n<li>This confirms the hypothesis that one of the main functions of sensory centers is to efficiently code the patterns of excitation that occur, thus developing a less-redundant representation of the environment.</li>\n<li>E.g. A modified code developed in response to a modified environment.</li>\n<li>Given this, the properties of cells higher in the hierarchy are presumably themselves experiment-dependent and are fed information from these experience-dependent neurons at the lower cortical levels.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Current concept of the single neuron\n<ul>\n<li>The culmination of the previous results leads us to the conclusion that each neuron can perform a more complex and subtle task than previously thought.</li>\n<li>E.g. Neurons don’t loosely and unreliably map the luminous intensities of the visual image but instead they detect pattern elements, discriminate the depth of objects, ignore irrelevant causes of variation, and are arranged in a hierarchy.</li>\n<li>Furthermore, there’s evidence that neurons give prominence to what’s informationally important, can respond with great reliability, and can have their pattern selectivity permanently modified by early visual experience.</li>\n<li>We shouldn’t use phrases like “neuronal activity reflects, reveals, or monitors thought processes” because neuronal activity are thought processes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Five propositions\n<ol>\n<li>The activity of a neuron, which is received from and transmitted to other neurons, is a complete description for functionally understanding the nervous system. There’s nothing else “looking at” or controlling this activity, which must be the basis for understanding how the brain controls behavior.</li>\n<li>At progressively higher levels in sensory pathways, information about the physical stimulus is carried by progressively fewer active neurons. The sensory system is organized to achieve as complete a representation with the minimum number of active neurons.</li>\n<li>Trigger features of neurons are matched to the redundant features of sensory stimuli in order to achieve greater completeness and economy of representation. This selective responsiveness is determined by the stimuli that neurons are exposed to and by genetic factors.</li>\n<li>Just as physical stimuli directly cause receptors to initiate neural activity, so to do the high-level neurons directly and simply cause the elements of our perception.</li>\n<li>The frequency of neural impulses encodes subjective certainty as a high impulse frequency corresponds to a high degree of confidence that the cause of the percept is present in the external world.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>First proposition: significant level of description\n<ul>\n<li>Asserts that how the brain works by processing and representing sensory information can be built up from knowledge of the interactions of individual cells.</li>\n<li>It was thought that a property of a group of cells was analogous to temperature or pressure as a property of a collection of molecules that individually behave randomly.</li>\n<li>However, evidence that single neurons have diverse and highly specific responsiveness to sensory stimuli, and are astonishingly reliable, showed the fallacy of this analogy.</li>\n<li>It no longer seems unrealistic to attempt to understand perception at the atomic single-unit level.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Second proposition: the economical representation of sensory messages\n<ul>\n<li>At the higher levels, fewer and fewer cells are active but each represents a progressively more specific happening in the sensory environment.</li>\n<li>The pattern specificity (now called receptive field) of sensory neurons is the aspect that’s most widely emphasized.</li>\n<li>However, equally remarkable is the invariance of the response to changes in the stimulus.</li>\n<li>E.g. A single long-cone photoreceptor is specific in that long-wavelength light must be present at a particular part of the image to excite it, and it’s general in that all images with this property will excite it. In contrast, high-level neurons aren’t limited to purely local attributes of the image but are selective for patterns that requires a considerable region of the image to be taken into account.</li>\n<li>The fact that many parallel communication channels are used in the nervous system has been widely recognized, but here we see an enormous expansion of the number of parallel paths without many redundant channels as each neuron seems to have a different specific responsiveness.</li>\n<li>It’s as if the activity of a low-level neuron is like a letter, then the activity of a high-level neuron is like a word, a meaningful combination of letters.</li>\n<li>The retina recoding of light information changes the distribution of neural activity so that low impulse frequencies are common and high impulse frequencies are rare.</li>\n<li>Low levels of visual information are carried by the pattern of joint activity of many elements, whereas at the higher levels, a smaller proportion are active and each of these say a lot when active.</li>\n<li>The overall goal of information processing in higher sensory areas is to represent the input as completely as possible by activity in as few neurons as possible.</li>\n<li>Visual information is enormously redundant and it’s been suggested that sensory coding is the exploitation of this redundancy to get a more economical representation of the information.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Third proposition: selectivity adapted to environment\n<ul>\n<li>Sensory stimulation doesn’t randomly range over the whole scale of possible values.</li>\n<li>Adaptation of peripheral receptors may achieve economy by signalling changes from the mean instead of absolute values.</li>\n<li>In most situations, neighboring points on a sensory surface are more likely to be similar than distant points, so it makes sense to regard contrast enhancement by lateral inhibition as another economy measure.</li>\n<li>We can also achieve economy by exploiting the redundancy of particular sensory scenes using neural plasticity.</li>\n<li>Visual adaptation to changes in dark and light is a simple example of reversible plasticity.</li>\n<li>E.g. Common luminances require the fewest impulses.</li>\n<li>Permanent effects on the visual system during the sensitive periods are examples of plasticity for a particular type of redundancy.</li>\n<li>E.g. For visual features experienced during the sensitive period, neurons will be biased towards those features.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Fourth proposition: origin of perceptions\n<ul>\n<li>Review of the neural basis of consciousness and conscious perception.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Fifth proposition: signalling subjective certainty\n<ul>\n<li>Review of viewing neurons as binary in nature or “duality”.</li>\n<li>Impulse frequency signals some function of significance.</li>\n<li>E.g.

Yet in vivo, the mean firing rate of neurons is around 4 Hz.</li>\n<li>To explain this difference, Levy and Baxter suggested that the nervous system maximizes the ratio of information transmitted to energy consumed rather than maximizing coding capacity.</li>\n<li>Using a new equation to relate information transmitted and energy consumption, we arrive at the surprising conclusion that the energetic design of synapses is optimal if presynaptic release of transmitter fails often, just as is seen in most synapses.</li>\n<li>To understand this, we need to consider information flow through synapses and the energy it consumes.</li>\n<li>For a synapse with a single release site, if each time a presynaptic action potential arrives a vesicle is released with probability p, then for p less than one, information is lost during synaptic transmission.</li>\n<li>E.g. If the postsynaptic cell gets a postsynaptic current, then it must have been caused by the presynaptic cell. However, if the postsynaptic cell doesn’t get a postsynaptic current, then this could be due to multiple reasons such as no presynaptic action potential or an action potential failing to evoke transmitter release.</li>\n<li>The amount of information passing through a synapse can be measured using mutual information.</li>\n<li>Mutual information: how much the sequence of postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) tells us about the input train of action potentials (APs).</li>\n<li>If we take typical physiological values of s=0.01 (S = 4 Hz) and p=0.25, we find that out of the 32 bits/s arriving at the synapse, only 6.8 bits/s are transmitted. Thus, information transmission typically costs around 24,000 ATP per bit.</li>\n<li>If both the fraction of information transmitted and the information transmitted per unit energy are maximized when the vesicle release probability is 1, then why do CNS synapses typically have a release probability of 0.25-0.5?</li>\n<li>Here we show that optimal energetic design of CNS synapses requires failure of presynaptic release.</li>\n<li>Low release probability allows synapses to have a wide dynamic range and increases information transmission from correlated inputs.</li>\n<li>Also, the existence of multiple synaptic release sites from axon to dendrite results in the ratio of information transmitted to energy used being larger if the release probability is low.</li>\n<li>The use of multiple synaptic release sites, usually onto different spines, may exist to ensure stable information processing in the face of spine turnover.</li>\n<li>If the rate that information arrives in all synapses on the dendritic tree is matched to the rate that the output axon of the cell can convey information, this also implies that synaptic failures should occur.</li>\n<li>Failures of synaptic transmission would reduce energy waste since the output axon can’t convey all of the information it receives.</li>\n<li>Two types of synapses\n<ul>\n<li>Relay: function is to simply pass on information.</li>\n<li>Information processing: function is to integrate information.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For a relay synapse, if the number of receptors is too small, then no postsynaptic action potential will be produced and thus no information is transmitted.</li>\n<li>How is the massive energy use of synapses sustained?</li>\n<li>Synapse energy is mainly provided by mitochondria (93%) with the rest (7%) coming from glycolysis.</li>\n<li>While most brain energy is used by synapses, the brain’s only energy store, glycogen, is located in astrocytes.</li>\n<li>Glycogen can sustain neural activity for a few minutes when glucose and oxygen supplies are compromised.</li>\n<li>Since synaptic activity changes dramatically on various time scales, how is ATP production by synaptic mitochondria regulated to match this demand?</li>\n<li>The rise of intracellular calcium ions signals to mitochondria to increase ATP production in response to synaptic activity.</li>\n<li>On either side of most synapses, there’s approximately one mitochondria.</li>\n<li>Mitochondria migrate to the synapse because if ATP were synthesized at the soma, it would take over 2 minutes to diffuse to the end of a 200 micrometer dendrite and 10 years to diffuse to the end of a 1 meter axon.</li>\n<li>This prevents rapid adaptation of the ATP supply in response to changing pre- and postsynaptic activity.</li>\n<li>Instead, mitochondria are transported long distances around neurons by kinesin and dynein motors.</li>\n<li>We’ve covered how synapses reduce their energy use and where they get their energy from. We now turn to changes in synaptic energy use in development, synaptic plasticity, and sleep.</li>\n<li>As brains develop, they initially increase their energy use above the adult value until adolescence.</li>\n<li>These changes correlate with an increase in the thickness of the cortex as many synaptic connections are made followed by cortical thinning and synaptic pruning.</li>\n<li>The high energy use during development reflects both the larger number of energy-consuming synapses but also the ATP used to synthesize cellular components.</li>\n<li>Synaptic strength in the mature brain can increase or decrease by plasticity processes, which will alter energy expenditure.</li>\n<li>E.g. NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation can double the strength of synapses by inserting more AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane, doubling postsynaptic energy use thus requiring an increased ATP supply.</li>\n<li>To avoid an unstoppable increased in synapse strength and hence energy expenditure, homeostatic plasticity renormalizes the strength of synapses.</li>\n<li>Synaptic plasticity can also offer energetic savings to synaptic transmission.</li>\n<li>E.g. Silent synapses are optimal for information storage but also provide a massive decrease in the amount of energy used.</li>\n<li>In the last section, we turn to the pathological effects of disruptions to synaptic energy.</li>\n<li>Any disorder of mitochondrial trafficking or function will affect synapses.</li>\n<li>E.g. In Parkinson’s disease, dopaminergic neurons consume a significant amount of ATP to reverse the calcium ion influx that mediate their pacemaking activity.</li>\n<li>E.g. In Huntington’s disease, mitochondrial defects may contribute to the preferential loss of spiny GABAergic neurons in the striatum by disrupting the trafficking of mitochondria to synapses.</li>\n<li>E.g. In familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, mitochondrial abnormalities at the neuromuscular junction have been implicated.</li>\n<li>Of the brain’s components, synapses consume the most energy.</li>\n<li>Since there tend to be more than one release site at synaptic connections, this implies that the information transmitted per ATP consumed can be maximized by employing multiple release sites with a low release probability.</li>\n</ul>","tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#the-hippocampal-memory-indexing-theory\">The Hippocampal Memory Indexing Theory</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#what-happened-to-mirror-neurons\">What Happened to Mirror Neurons?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#representational-drift-in-primary-olfactory-cortex\">Representational drift in primary olfactory cortex</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#humans-can-discriminate-more-than-1-trillion-olfactory-stimuli\">Humans Can Discriminate More than 1 Trillion Olfactory Stimuli</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#critical-role-of-the-hippocampus-in-memory-for-elapsed-time\">Critical Role of the Hippocampus in Memory for Elapsed Time</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#brain-circuits-for-the-internal-monitoring-of-movements\">Brain Circuits for the Internal Monitoring of Movements</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#primary-sensory-cortices-contain-distinguishable-spatial-patterns-of-activity-for-each-sense\">Primary sensory cortices contain distinguishable spatial patterns of activity for each sense</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#an-integrative-theory-of-prefrontal-cortex-function\">An Integrative Theory of Prefrontal Cortex Function</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#metaplasticity-tuning-synapses-and-networks-for-plasticity\">Metaplasticity: tuning synapses and networks for plasticity</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#saturated-reconstruction-of-a-volume-of-neocortex\">Saturated Reconstruction of a Volume of Neocortex</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#the-body-model-theory-of-somatosensory-cortex\">The Body Model Theory of Somatosensory Cortex</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#space-time-wiring-specificity-supports-direction-selectivity-in-the-retina\">Space-time wiring specificity supports direction selectivity in the retina</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#brains-as-computers-metaphor-analogy-theory-or-fact\">Brains as computers: metaphor, analogy, theory or fact?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#metabolic-rate-and-body-size-are-linked-with-perception-of-temporal-information\">Metabolic rate and body size are linked with perception of temporal information</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#scanning-the-horizon-towards-transparent-and-reproducible-neuroimaging-research\">Scanning the horizon: towards transparent and reproducible neuroimaging research</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#single-units-and-sensation-a-neuron-doctrine-for-perceptual-psychology\">Single Units and Sensation: A Neuron Doctrine for Perceptual Psychology?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#the-labelled-lines-principle-of-the-somatosensory-physiology-might-explain-the-phantom-limb-phenomenon\">The labelled-lines principle of the somatosensory physiology might explain the phantom limb phenomenon</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#reliability-of-spike-timing-in-neocortical-neurons\">Reliability of Spike Timing in Neocortical Neurons</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#different-sensations-from-cones-with-the-same-photopigment\">Different sensations from cones with the same photopigment</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#synaptic-energy-use-and-supply\">Synaptic Energy Use and Supply</a></li>\n</ul>","timeToRead":84,"frontmatter":{"title":"Neuroscience Papers Set 6","date":"April 03, 2022","book_authors":null,"categories":["Papers"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/papers/neuroscience-set-6/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/books/being-you/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Being You","layout":"post"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/papers/neuroscience-set-7/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Neuroscience Papers Set 7","layout":"post"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1031357278","1878747374","3666494887"],"slicesMap":{}}
