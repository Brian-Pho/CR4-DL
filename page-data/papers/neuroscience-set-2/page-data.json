Partial blockade of OSVZ progenitor proliferation in the developing ferret cortex without losing many neurons leads to a reduction in size of cortical folds and lissencephaly. The opposite, a forced overproliferation, significantly increases cortical surface area and folding.</li>\n<li>Mounting evidence from comparative neuroanatomy strongly supports that increased neuron numbers aren’t sufficient for cortical folding, and that additional mechanisms are required.</li>\n<li>The tangential dispersion of radially migrating neurons seems key in the expansion of cortical surface area that leads to folding, and this depends on an abundance of bRGCs.</li>\n<li>So regulation of the different types of cortical progenitors, particularly bRGCs, is critical in this process.</li>\n<li>bRGCs are generated from aRGCs in the VZ.</li>\n<li>A landmark finding on the molecular regulation of cortical folding by control of progenitor cell lineage was the identification of Trnp1.</li>\n<li>Trnp1 is strongly expressed in self-amplifying aRGCs and its expression decreases as aRCGs gradually stop self-amplifying to produce IPCs and neurons.</li>\n<li>Trnp1 was the first gene able to induce genuine folding of the mouse cerebral cortex.</li>\n<li>Another gene, ARHGAP11B, also drives folding in the mouse cerebral cortex and likely has a central role in human brain evolution and uniqueness.</li>\n<li>What defines the location and shape of cortical folds and fissures?</li>\n<li>The traditional view is that the folds form randomly due to cortical growth exceeding cranial volume.</li>\n<li>However, evidence indicates that this is wrong.</li>\n<li>E.g. If a part of the cerebrum fails to develop/grow, the skull tends to conform to the size and shape of the remaining neural tissue, which still folds. Thus limited cranial volume doesn’t force cortical folding.</li>\n<li>Further evidence against the traditional view is that the pattern of folds and fissures is highly stereotyped and well conserved among individuals of a species.</li>\n<li>Also, folding patterns of phylogenetically related species follow remarkably similar trends and even in species with large cortices, like humans, the deepest and earliest fissures to develop do so at strikingly conserved positions.</li>\n<li>E.g. Twins.</li>\n<li>To summarize, cortical folding patterns appear to be due to strong genetic regulation.</li>\n<li>The location of cortical folds and fissures is preceded and mirrored by regional variations in progenitor cell proliferation.</li>\n<li>Expression modules along the OSVZ faithfully map the eventual location of cortical folds and fissures.</li>\n<li>One hypothesis on the biomechanics of cortical folding is that cranial volume limits cortical size, so that as cortical tissue grows in surface area, the skull offers resistance to its outward expansion, thus forcing the neural tissue to buckle and fold onto itself.</li>\n<li>This has been disproven for the mammalian brain as cortical folding takes place even in the absence of compressive constrain from the skull.</li>\n<li>Another hypothesis is that tension between neurons could cause folding.</li>\n<li>However, this has also been challenged by cutting axons in living brains and seeing if the folds relax.

In genetics, the major principles of genetics were all inferred from external evidence long before the internal molecular structure of the gene was even seriously thought about.</li>\n<li>Neuroscience has been focused of late on neural circuits.</li>\n<li>Paper contends that such an approach is simply not going to yield the kind of insight and explanation that we ultimately demand from neuroscience.</li>\n<li>Instead, we should have a more pluralistic conception of mechanistic understanding.</li>\n<li>Pluralism in science: the doctrine advocating the cultivation of multiple systems of practice in any given field of science.</li>\n<li>“Without the proper technological advances, the road ahead is blocked.

If we play a 200 cycles per second tone, we should expect 200 impulses per second to be transmitted by the auditory nerve to the cochlear nuclei. Since the tones at the two ears are in phase and have the same intensity, we expect the impulses to reach the nuclei at the same time.</li>\n<li>In figure 1, this would mean fiber 4 receives the stimuli simultaneously from both sides every 1/200th of a second.</li>\n<li>The other fibers will also receive stimuli from both sides but since it isn’t simultaneous (due to the delay from sending signals), no spatial summation occurs.</li>\n<li>If we move the sound source to the left, then fibers 6/7 will be stimulated because the sound takes more time to travel from the right but less time from the left side.</li>\n<li>Thus, we have a difference of time represented as a difference in place.</li>\n<li>Possible locations of this mechanism\n<ul>\n<li>We need a location where connections from both ears are found and where the delays due to prior synapses have been equal, so that the impulses are in-phase until the mechanism.</li>\n<li>The most obvious place is the superior olivary nucleus (SON) but another study suggests that this isn’t the location of the mechanism.</li>\n<li>The issue with SON is that when out-of-phase sounds are presented and we record from SON, we find that the activity is equal to the time difference of the stimuli (which is the input we need).</li>\n<li>Another place is either the inferior colliculus or the medial geniculate body since they take inputs from SON.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"new-roles-for-synaptic-inhibition-in-sound-localization\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#new-roles-for-synaptic-inhibition-in-sound-localization\" aria-label=\"new roles for synaptic inhibition in sound localization permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn1136\">New roles for synaptic inhibition in sound localization</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Traditionally, it was thought that the underlying mechanism for localizing sounds involved only coincidence detection of excitatory inputs from the two ears (Jeffress model).</li>\n<li>However, recent findings have uncovered profound roles for synaptic inhibition in the processing of interaural time differences (ITDs).</li>\n<li>E.g. In mammals, timed hyperpolarizing inhibition adjusts the temporal sensitivity of coincidence detector neurons to the physiologically relevant range of ITD. In birds, however, they use inhibition to control for gain.</li>\n<li>Interaural time differences (ITD): the difference in the arrival time of a sound at the two ears.</li>\n<li>ITD is the main cue for localizing low-frequency sounds.</li>\n<li>The evolution of sophisticated auditory systems occurred completely independently in birds and mammals, although it was driven by the same evolutionary constraints.</li>\n<li>The neural circuits that encode ITDs in birds and mammals exemplify how the evolution of the vertebrate brain came up with different solutions for the same problem.</li>\n<li>For both birds and mammals, ITD processing represents the ultimate challenge in temporal processing, as no other neural system in vertebrates comes close to the temporal resolution required to encode ITDs (except for the electric system in some fish).</li>\n<li>Interestingly, the duration of an AP is almost two orders of magnitude greater than the minimal ITDs that both barn owls and humans can resolve (&#x3C; 10 <span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>μ</mi><mi>s</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mu s</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">μ</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">s</span></span></span></span></span>).</li>\n<li>Thus, we can use ITD as a case study for understanding the rules that underlie precise temporal processing in the vertebrate brain.</li>\n<li>Review of the Jeffress model (time-lock/phase-locked, coincidence detection, delay lines, and topographical representation of azimuthal space).</li>\n<li>The bird ITD-encoding system seems to have evolved in a way that closely matches Jeffress’s predictions.</li>\n<li>E.g. The nucleus laminaris in birds act as coincidence detectors.</li>\n<li>In birds, the GABA-mediated inhibition operates as a differential gain control system to keep the coincidence detector in an appropriate working range and seems to compensate for other binaural influences.</li>\n<li>In mammals, however, there’s increasingly conflicting evidence about the validity of the Jeffress model for the mammalian ITD encoder.</li>\n<li>E.g. Single neuron reconstruction of the medial superior olive (MSO) revealed that the anatomical projection patterns didn’t fit the concept of delay lines. Tracer injections provide only weak evidence for such delay lines.</li>\n<li>More importantly, and despite many attempts, no ITD map has been convincingly shown in the mammalian auditory system, including the cat.</li>\n<li>Another piece of conflicting evidence is that studies in the rabbit and guinea-pig show that many or most neurons showed maximal ITD sensitivity outside the physiologically relevant range of ITDs.</li>\n<li>Not only is the representation of ITDs in mammals inconsistent with the old textbook view, but there is also conspicuous binaural inhibition innervating MSO neurons.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

MNTB cells receive projections from globular bushy cells (GBCs) in the VCN, which follow the temporal structure of sound with exceptional precision.</li>\n<li>By precisely sending the sound signal, temporal summation is avoided in this pathway.</li>\n<li>The axon diameters of these projections are the largest in the auditory brainstem and use the most secure synapses in the mammalian brain.</li>\n<li>Thus, MNTB cells are reliably phase-locked to frequencies beyond 1 kHz and therefore convert temporally precise excitation into temporally precise inhibition.</li>\n<li>Only recently have we understood what the MNTB is used for.</li>\n<li>One use is that the MNTB targets the lateral superior olive (LSO), which is the initial site of interaural intensity difference processing; used to localize high-frequency sounds.</li>\n<li>A more important use of the MNTB is that it targets two other areas, the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus and the MSO, both of which are involved in temporal processing.</li>\n<li>So, the reason for the highly specialized inhibition might not be for ITD processing, but rather for processing temporal cues.</li>\n<li>The second pathway is from the lateral nucleus of the trapezoid body (LNTB).</li>\n<li>LNTB neurons also receive inputs from GBCs.</li>\n<li>However, what’s the purpose of these inhibitory inputs to the MSO? And does their timing really matter?</li>\n<li>One function is that the timing of inhibition in the MSO is important for setting a time window for coincidence detection.</li>\n<li>However, experimentation with blocking the inhibition has revealed two conclusions\n<ul>\n<li>First, the excitatory inputs are generally adjusted so that the overall conductance delay from both sides is identical. As a consequence, the MSO coincidence detection based on excitation causes ITD functions to peak around zero ITD.</li>\n<li>Second, the inhibition adjusts the slope of the ITD function to the physiologically relevant range, which gives the maximum amount of information because small changes in ITD cause maximal changes in discharge rates.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What role do inhibitory inputs play in these two conclusion?</li>\n<li>One hypothesis is that opposite-side driven inhibition precedes the excitation from the same side, therefore delaying the net EPSP and shifting the maximum of the ITD function.</li>\n<li>Preliminary evidence confirms that opposite-side inhibition does precedes same-side excitation and that same-side inhibition lags behind same-side excitation.</li>\n<li>One note is that the rat and bat MSO structurally differs from ITD-using mammals such as gerbils and cats.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 699px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/CR4-DL/static/cdc2c7b4125ca97e5fc085dfa19358a6/3fe45/figure6-6.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 126%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Figure 6\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/CR4-DL/static/cdc2c7b4125ca97e5fc085dfa19358a6/3fe45/figure6-6.png\"\n        srcset=\"/CR4-DL/static/cdc2c7b4125ca97e5fc085dfa19358a6/63868/figure6-6.png 250w,\n/CR4-DL/static/cdc2c7b4125ca97e5fc085dfa19358a6/0b533/figure6-6.png 500w,\n/CR4-DL/static/cdc2c7b4125ca97e5fc085dfa19358a6/3fe45/figure6-6.png 699w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The question remains on whether mammals with significantly larger inter-ear differences represent ITDs in the same way as do guinea pigs and gerbils remains to be explored.</li>\n<li>Going back to birds, the delay-line organization of the excitatory inputs results in a topographic map of ITDs in the nucleus laminaris.

In birds, the inhibition causes depolarizing IPSPs, which are even more effective in preventing the cell from firing.</li>\n<li>These difference suggest that inhibition is used as a feedback circuit for gain control that prevents coincidence detectors from firing as a result of increased monaural coincidence at higher sound amplitudes.</li>\n<li>Indeed, the ability of barn owls to encode ITDs is

square root of cortical thickness.</li>\n<li>This model also explains the scaling of the folding index of crumpled paper balls (but we know this is wrong as seen in the first paper of this set of notes).</li>\n<li>Cortical folding has been considered as a means of allowing more neurons to be in the cerebral cortex compared to not folding.</li>\n<li>We see different gyrification (foldedness) across different species, which suggests different mechanisms that regulate cortical folding at the evolutionary, species-specific, and ontogenetic levels.</li>\n<li>We find a general correlation between total brain mass and degree of cortical folding, but it isn’t a smooth function of brain mass and looks like a ReLU.</li>\n<li>Interestingly, all brains with less than 30 million neurons are smooth, which may be an artifact of the dataset or it may mean something.</li>\n<li>Regardless, the correlation between number of cortical neurons and degree of cortical folding is significant across gyrencephalic species.</li>\n<li>The elephant cortex is about twice as folded as the human cortex, but only has about 1/3 the number of neurons.</li>\n<li>Cortical expansion and folding are therefore neither a direct consequence of increasing numbers of neurons nor a requirement for increasing numbers of neurons in the cortex.</li>\n<li>Interestingly, all brains with less than 400 <span

smooth.</li>\n<li>In all of our comparisons of folding index to brain mass, number of cortical neurons, total cortical surface area, and cortical thickness, we find a sharp inflection between smooth and wrinkled/gyrated cortices, so it’s unlikely that a universal model could explain cortical folding.</li>\n<li>Folding index: a ratio of the total surface area to exposed surface area.</li>\n<li>There’s a strong relationship between a brain’s total surface area and it’s foldedness, as increases in surface area strongly related to increases in foldedness.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1000px; \"\n    >\n

Continuing the ASSC20 debate</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Paper continues the ASSC20 symposium discussion on “Does unconscious perception really exist?”</li>\n<li>The core of the controversy is what is meant by the terms and how to test whether a state is unconscious or not.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Practical and theoretical considerations in seeking the neural correlates of consciousness</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>As scientists studying consciousness, we should be concerned with how we can isolate conscious processing from unconscious processing, so that we can study the neural processing that underlies awareness, the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC).</li>\n<li>Two pervasive and closely related potential confounds in the study of consciousness are\n<ul>\n<li>Stimulus signal strength</li>\n<li>Task performance capacity</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Both of these need to be controlled for if we want to isolate awareness.</li>\n<li>To control for stimulus signal strength, we should design experiments where stimulus properties don’t vary across conscious and unconscious conditions.</li>\n<li>E.g. Using a large, bright stimulus for the conscious condition and a small, dim stimulus for the unconscious condition.</li>\n<li>To control for task performance capacity, we should design experiments where the performance doesn’t vary across conscious and unconscious conditions.</li>\n<li>E.g. If a person blinks during a visual experiment, that will change their performance.</li>\n<li>Unconscious stimulus: an observer’s subjective experience of the stimulus shouldn’t be any different from the subjective experience of nothing at all.</li>\n<li>One objection to this definition is that it fails to capture the aspect of qualia.</li>\n<li>E.g. An observer may have a hunch that something is present such as in the case of blindsight.</li>\n<li>However, is qualia necessary to study the NCC of subjective awareness? Author argues no.</li>\n<li>In experiments seeking the NCC, awareness of a stimulus is present if the subjective experience of that stimulus is different from the subjective experience of the stimulus’ absence.</li>\n<li>Perception: occurs when an observer can make some direct discrimination decision about the stimulus better than guessing.</li>\n<li>This definition excludes priming.</li>\n<li>In priming tasks, the unconscious prime doesn’t meet our definition of perception since you can’t discriminate or detect the prime beyond chance level.</li>\n<li>With these definitions, we have successfully isolated consciousness while controlling for other confounding factors.</li>\n<li>Criterion problem: just because an observer reports that they didn’t see a stimulus doesn’t mean they had zero subjective experience of it, only that the subjective experience fell below some arbitrary threshold for reporting.</li>\n<li>The criterion problem represents a very real and fundamental problem that prevents us from exhaustively measuring the presence or absence of awareness.</li>\n<li>Author presents a study where participants had to discriminate a masked target that was either there or not there.</li>\n<li>The result of the study suggested no evidence for unconscious perception.</li>\n<li>E.g.

No other organ system is associated with as long a list of incurable diseases as the brain.</li>\n<li>Worse yet, there isn’t only no cure, but no clear idea of what’s wrong.</li>\n<li>The nervous system is a physical tissue that is unlike any other organ system.</li>\n<li>E.g. It has more cell types than any other organ such as the 50 in the retina compared to the 5 in the liver. Neurons connect to many more cells, and the neuronal contacts give rise to circuits that have no analogs in other tissues.</li>\n<li>Perhaps the most intriguing difference between neural tissue and other organs is that the cellular structure of neural tissue is a product of both genetics and experience.</li>\n<li>The special structural features of the nervous system are likely the reason why it’s more difficult to understand compared to other bodily systems.</li>\n<li>This is the argument for why we should go after the structural connectome of the nervous system.</li>\n<li>Top ten arguments against connectomics\n<ol>\n<li>Circuit structure is different from circuit function.\n<ul>\n<li>The argument is that nervous system behavior is a direct function of the functional properties of neurons (electrical), rather than the anatomical connections.</li>\n<li>In other words, the relationship between firing patterns and neuron function are the key to bridge the gap between cells and behavior.</li>\n<li>However, long term learning of skills and experiences is probably implemented in the specific pattern of connections between neurons.</li>\n<li>So, experience alters connections between neurons to record a memory for later recall.</li>\n<li>Both the sensory experience that lays down a memory and its later recall are trains of APs, but in-between these two processes is a stable physical structure that holds that memory.</li>\n<li>In this sense, memory is a connectional map within the brain.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Signals without synapses and synapses without signals.\n<ul>\n<li>The argument is that chemical cues in the brain would be difficult/impossible to infer from anatomical wiring diagrams.</li>\n<li>It’s true that a map of synaptic connectivity isn’t identical to a map of the signaling pathways of the brain.</li>\n<li>We should be careful to not confuse the goals of connectomics with the aims of maps of the activity patterns in the nervous system.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>‘Junk’ synapses.\n<ul>\n<li>The argument is that most synapses are functionally negligible and what really matters is the general likelihood of connectivity.</li>\n<li>If junk synapses are common, then going to the trouble of itemizing all synaptic connections is both a waste of time and a distraction.</li>\n<li>It’s premature to say that such synapses are ‘junk’ given how little we know about their function.</li>\n<li>We aren’t convinced that the nervous system tolerates a large number of synapses that don’t serve a useful function.</li>\n<li>In fact, many synapses are pruned during development if they aren’t useful.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Same structure, many functions.\n<ul>\n<li>The argument is that because the same neurons and circuits can be modulated and thus produce flexible behavior, it isn’t possible to assign a neuron a function without knowing the behavioral state.</li>\n<li>However, the extent to which this kind of switching is a general feature of nervous systems isn’t well known.</li>\n<li>An understanding of the physiology of the nervous system would enable us to map the multiple functions to the same structure, and thus would help organize our knowledge.</li>\n<li>How would you know that a different function came from the same structure if you haven’t characterized the structure?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Same function, many structures.\n<ul>\n<li>The argument is that the same function could be realized by multiple different structures, so characterizing the structure isn’t very useful.</li>\n<li>However, variability in connections doesn’t necessarily mean that the result is incomprehensible.</li>\n<li>E.g. Nerve-muscle connections differ quite a bit from one instantiation to the next, but there is a skewed distribution in each muscle, even though the exact location and branching pattern is unique.</li>\n<li>Thus, each instantiation appears to be a variation on a common theme.</li>\n<li>One reason we believe connectomics is necessary is that it’s the only way to derive network principles despite variability in the connectivity of neurons.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Statistical synapses should suffice.\n<ul>\n<li>The argument is that similar to statistical mechanics in physics, given the trillions of synapses in the brain, is there really any alternative except to take a statistical approach to synaptic connectivity?</li>\n<li>However, unlike a homogeneous gas, brains are made up of heterogenous tissue that have different properties depending on the tissue. So statistical methods can’t be applied to the entire brain.</li>\n<li>Also, the variety of cell types aren’t uniform, unlike that of gas molecules, so statistics can’t be applied to such varied data.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The mind is no match for the complexity of the brain.\n<ul>\n<li>The argument is that the brain’s structural complexity far outstrips the complexity of the mind.

If the prisoner’s dilemma is converted into a motor task, then both subjects work towards the Nash solution (both defecting).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Classes of control\n<ul>\n<li>Three classes of control\n<ul>\n<li>Predictive/feedforward</li>\n<li>Reactive</li>\n<li>Biomechanical</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Due to time delays during neural conduction, skilled action often relies on predictive control.</li>\n<li>E.g. When lifting an object, people often apply force in anticipation of its weight.</li>\n<li>This prediction requires a system that can effectively simulate the behavior of our body and environment, also known as the forward model.</li>\n<li>Using a copy of the motor command (efference copy), the forward model predicts the sensory consequences of that command.</li>\n<li>Prediction is supported by learned correlations or priors.</li>\n<li>E.g. When lifting an object, people use information about material size, volume, and density to predict its weight.</li>\n<li>If the prediction is incorrect, such as a mismatch between predicted and actual tactile sensation, then the system can launch corrective actions and can also update the knowledge of object weight to improve future actions.</li>\n<li>Through the prediction of sensory consequences, there’s an intimate relationship between predictive and reactive control mechanisms.</li>\n<li>Fast reactive feedback loops can drive fast motor responses but can’t be modified by experience.</li>\n<li>E.g. Reflexes.</li>\n<li>Evidence suggests that the CNS continuously converts sensory inputs into motor commands that are optimally tuned to the goals of the task by trading off energy consumption with accuracy.</li>\n<li>This is consistent with the optimal feedback control model of sensorimotor learning.</li>\n<li>Minimum intervention principle: only correcting errors to the task goal.</li>\n<li>As for biomechanical control, the body can manipulate muscle stiffness and thus, exert control over the immediate response to external perturbations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Processes of motor learning\n<ul>\n<li>Different types of learning can be distinguished by the type of learning signal.</li>\n<li>Error-based learning\n<ul>\n<li>The difference between the sensorimotor system’s prediction and actual outcome not only tells the system that it missed the goal, but also specifies the way in which the target was missed.</li>\n<li>A common feature of this type of learning is that the system can, and will, learn from an error on a single trial.</li>\n<li>Thus, adaption is observable even when all perturbations are random (thus unlearnable) and the subject is told not to adapt.</li>\n<li>Evidence indicates that fast trial-by-trial error-based learning relies on the cerebellum.</li>\n<li>E.g. Cerebellar lesions result in substantial impairment in fast adaptation across many task domains.</li>\n<li>How the cerebellum and cortex interact during error-based learning and where different types of adaptation are stored remains an open question.</li>\n</ul>\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 949px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/CR4-DL/static/9279e51473f1691c80b30494c72c5433/14060/figure1-13.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 92.4%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Figure 1\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/CR4-DL/static/9279e51473f1691c80b30494c72c5433/14060/figure1-13.png\"\n        srcset=\"/CR4-DL/static/9279e51473f1691c80b30494c72c5433/63868/figure1-13.png 250w,\n/CR4-DL/static/9279e51473f1691c80b30494c72c5433/0b533/figure1-13.png 500w,\n/CR4-DL/static/9279e51473f1691c80b30494c72c5433/14060/figure1-13.png 949w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 949px) 100vw, 949px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span>\n<ul>\n<li>During error-based learning, the system exploits a directional/signed error signal and follows an internal estimate of the gradient in this direction and thus, serves to calibrate and correct for any systematic biases.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Reinforcement learning\n<ul>\n<li>Error-based learning can reduce the average error to zero, but once this is achieved, it doesn’t provide a mechanism to further improve performance.</li>\n<li>In other words, error-based learning gets to the solution space, but doesn’t select the optimal solution within the solution space.</li>\n<li>To achieve a reduction in the variability of errors, other learning mechanisms are needed to move the system to the optimal location on the solution manifold.</li>\n<li>One candidate signal that could drive such learning is information about the relative success and failure of the movement.</li>\n<li>In contrast to a signed error signal, reinforcement signals are inherently unsigned, and therefore don’t give information about the direction of the required change.</li>\n<li>So, reinforcement learning is slower and requires exploration of different possibilities to guide learning.</li>\n<li>In situations where a complex sequence of actions need to take place and the outcome/reward is distant from the action, error-based learning can’t easily be applied.</li>\n<li>However, reinforcement learning can be used to assign credit/blame back in time to actions that led to success or failure.</li>\n<li>In general, we haven’t yet developed a full understanding of what makes a rewarding signal for the motor system.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Use-dependent learning\n<ul>\n<li>This learning doesn’t depend on the outcome and refers to the phenomenon that the motor system can change through the pure repetition of movements.</li>\n<li>E.g.

The temporal profile of a particular muscle activity. The overall motor output would be the sum of all primitives.</li>\n<li>The set of all primitives puts constraints on motor learning.</li>\n<li>E.g.

In the LGN, about 5 percent are driver inputs and 50 percent are modulator inputs.</li>\n<li>Identifying driver versus modulator components is important for understanding the functional organization of circuits.</li>\n<li>Every thalamic nucleus studied so far receives a feedback projection from layer 6 of the cortex, meaning that layer 6 cells project to the same thalamic region that innervates the layer 6 cortical region.</li>\n<li>However, layer 6 cells are highly heterogeneous so it’s difficult to find a single function for this feedback.</li>\n<li>An additional complicating factor is that layer 6 corticothalamic cells not only innervate the thalamus, but they also branch to innervate layer 4 of the cortex.</li>\n<li>This suggests that layer 6 can affect thalamocortical transmission both at its thalamic source and at its main cortical target in layer 4.</li>\n<li>Two types of thalamic relay\n<ul>\n<li>First order: thalamic nuclei that receive subcortical driver input.\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. LGN, VPMN, VMGN.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Higher order: thalamic nuclei that receive cortical driver input.\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. Pulvinar, PMN, DMGN.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Some thalamic relays get a driver input from layer 5 of the cortex.</li>\n<li>Higher order relays, which we estimate to be the majority of the thalamus by volume, are involved in the transfer of information between cortical areas.</li>\n<li>It appears often, and maybe always, that when cortical areas have a direct connection, they also have a parallel one through the thalamus. This parallel pathway is called transthalamic.</li>\n<li>Transthalamic pathway: corticothalamocortical circuits that go from cortex → thalamus → cortex.</li>\n<li>The medial dorsal nucleus seems to be organized as a higher order nucleus for prefrontal cortex and the ventral anterior-ventral lateral nuclei seems to be organized as a mosaic for motor cortex, one part serving as a first order relay for cerebellar inputs, and the other as a higher order relay.</li>\n<li>The pulvinar in both cat and monkey has neurons with receptive fields properties apparently inherited from cortical input, supporting their role as a link in transthalamic circuitry.</li>\n<li>Further evidence from the monkey indicates that the pulvinar plays a central role in the transfer of information between cortical areas.</li>\n<li>This supports the idea that transthalamic pathways provide the means that different cortical areas use to cooperate for various cognitive functions, such as attention.</li>\n<li>First order vs higher order relays\n<ul>\n<li>Higher order thalamic nuclei are more complex and heterogeneous than first order.</li>\n<li>Three key differences\n<ul>\n<li>First order nuclei appear to be completely first order, but higher order nuclei often include first order circuits.</li>\n<li>First order relays innervate cortex in a feedforward manner, but some higher order relays innervate primary sensory cortex, as well as higher areas.</li>\n<li>First order relays generally transfer information from one or a few driver inputs conveying similar information, but higher order relays seem to converge and elaborate information.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>It’s important to state that higher order areas are innervated by both layer 5 and subcortical driver inputs, thus going against the textbook view that the thalamus is just a gated relay.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The functional unit of the thalamus is the relay cell.</li>\n<li>Axonal branching is common among driver afferents to the thalamus.</li>\n<li>Are driver inputs to the thalamus efference copies?</li>\n<li>Efference copy: messages sent from motor areas of the brain back into appropriate sensory processing streams to anticipate resulting self-generated behaviors.</li>\n<li>Efference copies are an absolute requirement to allow organisms to disambiguate self-generated movements from external events.</li>\n<li>E.g. When we move our eyes, the visual world moves in the opposite direction but we don’t experience that movement because we anticipate the eye movement and account for it.</li>\n<li>E.g. When we touch a small animal, we know whether the movement is caused by the animal or by our hands moving.</li>\n<li>Coordinated behavior of any reasonably complex animal without efference copies is improbable.</li>\n<li>Efference copies require an accurate copy of a motor message to be directed back into the appropriate sensory processing stream.</li>\n<li>The copying process may be implemented as axonal branching since it sends identical messages to all of its targets.</li>\n<li>However, this doesn’t mean that the message has the same effect at all of its targets due to synaptic properties.</li>\n<li>This suggests a role for branching axons in efference copy circuits.</li>\n<li>Many, if not all, driver inputs to the thalamus involve branched axons.</li>\n<li>The new idea here is that as a cortical hierarchy is ascended, each level is kept informed about possible motor commands initiated by lower levels via the transthalamic pathways.</li>\n<li>So, this idea proposes that transthalamic pathways convey efference copies to other sensory areas for prediction and correction.</li>\n<li>This is also supported by evolution as when a new sensory receptor is acquired in the course of evolution, it won’t have any survival value if it lacks a fairly immediate motor output.</li>\n<li>Given that the cortex issues motor commands via layer 5, it seems obvious that these are correlated with efference copies that are convey over transthalamic pathways.</li>\n<li>This is only one plausible idea, there are others such as the pathways being used for information transfer or coordination.</li>\n<li>Efference copies are often discussed in very abstract form with no clear anatomical basis.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

How did I come up with the name of that animal? Why was it automatic?</li>\n<li>We seem to have limited introspective access to the origins and workings of cognitive processes.</li>\n<li>What separates cognitive processes that we’re aware of and those that we aren’t?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>That all of the different aspects of consciousness use a basic common mechanism.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We will ignore the following topics for now\n<ul>\n<li>Definition of consciousness.</li>\n<li>Function of consciousness.</li>\n<li>Consciousness in other animals.</li>\n<li>Language isn’t essential for consciousness.</li>\n<li>Self-consciousness such as the feeling of emotions, pain, thinking, etc.</li>\n<li>No neural theory of consciousness will explain everything about consciousness.</li>\n<li>Problem of qualia.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The most effective approach to the problem of consciousness would be to map features of consciousness onto the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of the brain.</li>\n<li>However, this hasn’t been very useful as such models just tell us what we already know: that consciousness uses attention, short-term memory, and that it should have easy access to higher levels of planning in the motor system.</li>\n<li>A major handicap to the study of consciousness is the influence of the paradigm of the von Neumann digital computer.</li>\n<li>However, one interesting view is that consciousness is like the operating system of the brain.</li>\n<li>Thus, the mechanisms of consciousness expresses the results of some of the computations the brain makes, but not the details of how they were done.</li>\n<li>Consciousness appears to be a process that is fairly immediate, with estimates in the range of 50-250 ms of perceiving a stimulus.</li>\n<li>General neurobiological aspects\n<ul>\n<li>When\n<ul>\n<li>When is an animal conscious? This isn’t a straightforward problem.</li>\n<li>We aren’t conscious in slow-wave sleep or under deep anesthesia.</li>\n<li>However, REM sleep is another matter.</li>\n<li>It seems that a limited form of consciousness occurs during REM sleep.</li>\n<li>E.g. Cognition isn’t completely normal and memories can’t be put into long-term storage.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Where\n<ul>\n<li>Where in the brain are the neural correlates of consciousness?\n<ul>\n<li>One of the traditional answers, that consciousness depends on the reticular activating system in the midbrain, is misleading.</li>\n<li>It’s true that the relevant parts of the brain need to be activated in various ways, but this is like believing that the characteristic part of a television set is its electrical power supply.</li>\n<li>It’s likely that consciousness occurs mainly in the neocortex, since local damage to the cerebral cortex often removes particular aspects of consciousness.</li>\n<li>E.g.

Cerebellum. Lesions of the cerebellum have little effect on consciousness and its contents.</li>\n<li>This contrasts with brainstem lesions as they typically cause coma by damaging the reticular activating system.</li>\n<li>However, there are cases of severe cortical damage but spared brainstem function and these patients typically remain in a vegetative state.</li>\n<li>This suggests that brainstem function is insufficient to sustain consciousness, but is a necessary prerequisite.</li>\n<li>It’s likely that the activity of heterogeneous neuronal populations within the brainstem, hypothalamus, and basal forebrain provide an important background condition for enabling consciousness.</li>\n<li>Subcortical neuromodulatory systems may not be needed for consciousness as shown by participants woken from NREM sleep, when the activity of most neuromodulatory systems is reduced, participants can still report being conscious.</li>\n<li>Unilateral and bilateral lesions of the basal ganglia can produce akinetic mutism, an emotionless state associated with preserved visual stimulus tracking.</li>\n<li>However, it isn’t clear whether the basal ganglia contributes directly or indirectly to consciousness.</li>\n<li>The role of the claustrum was hypothesized to play a critical role in integrating information for consciousness, but evidence is sparse for it’s role in consciousness.</li>\n<li>The role of the thalamus remains controversial. Some thalamic cells may represent critical enabling factors for consciousness but the activity of thalamic relay nuclei poorly correlates with the level of consciousness in vegetative state patients.</li>\n<li>Review of the case of blindsight, which happens with lesions of V1.</li>\n<li>Patients with damage to extrastriate visual areas that leave V1 intact can have quadrantanopia.</li>\n<li>Quadrantanopia: blindness for one-quarter of the visual field.</li>\n<li>This phenomenon suggests that V1 alone is insufficient for conscious vision.</li>\n<li>Evidence from blindsight and quadrantanopia both support the hypothesis that V1 isn’t part of the content-specific NCC. We don’t know if this extends to other primary sensory areas such as S1 and A1.</li>\n<li>More than a century of reports describing electrical brain stimulation during neurosurgery suggests that it’s difficult to directly elicit experiences from stimulation of frontal sites, which contrasts when stimulating the posterior cortex as it does trigger specific experiences.</li>\n<li>The commonly held view that the content of consciousness is linked to fronto-parietal activation ignores evidence from lesion studies that consciousness don’t require an intact prefrontal cortex.</li>\n<li>E.g. Bilateral frontal lobectomy, large bilateral prefrontal resections, prefrontal lobotomy, and leucotomy don’t impair consciousness.</li>\n<li>There was a case of a young woman with extensive bilateral prefrontal damage was found to have grossly deficient scores in tests of frontal lobe function, but had intact perceptual abilities and was obviously conscious.</li>\n<li>Taken together, the data suggest that frontal portions of the broad fronto-parietal network play a more prominent role in the control and execution of cognitive tasks rather than supporting experience.</li>\n<li>Evidence supports the hypothesis that preserved feedback connectivity is necessary for consciousness.</li>\n<li>Are certain neuronal cell types associated with specific aspects of consciousness?</li>\n<li>When the search for the NCC began, the discovery of synchronized neuronal discharges in the visual cortex lead to the proposal that consciousness requires the synchronization of populations of neurons in the gamma range.</li>\n<li>However, many of these studies didn’t carefully dissociate conscious visibility from selective attention and when this is corrected for, gamma synchrony correlates with attention.</li>\n<li>Other studies suggests that gamma synchrony can occur in the absence of conscious, which has lead to the conclusion that gamma band oscillations aren’t necessary for seeing.</li>\n<li>Another marker of consciousness is the late, positive, fronto-parietal ERP evoked by visual or auditory stimuli called the P3b.</li>\n<li>P3b has been proposed as a signature of consciousness.</li>\n<li>However, this interpretation has be contradicted by several experimental results.</li>\n<li>E.g. Task-irrelevant stimuli don’t trigger a P3b even though participants are clearly conscious of them and the reverse is true too.</li>\n<li>The P3b doesn’t signal conscious perception when participants already have a target stimulus held in working memory and is absent in the majority of brain damage patients who remain conscious.</li>\n<li>We conclude that P3b isn’t a marker of consciousness.</li>\n<li>Low-voltage fast activity in EEG recordings, also known as activated or desynchronized EEG, was and is one of the most sensitive and useful electrophysiological markers of consciousness.</li>\n<li>Detecting repeated high-amplitude slow waves in EEG is an effective way to assess the loss of consciousness in humans and is better than most available alternatives.</li>\n<li>However, distinguishing conscious from unconscious using global EEG isn’t always reliable.</li>\n<li>It may be that local, rather than global, EEG activation is important for consciousness, especially over the posterior cortical hot zone.</li>\n<li>Conclusion\n<ul>\n<li>It’s important to separate the specific contents of consciousness from changes in behavioral state.</li>\n<li>It’s also critical to consider not only correlative evidence from neuroimaging and unit recordings, but also causal evidence from brain stimulation and lesion studies.</li>\n<li>The anatomical basis of the full NCC and content-specific NCC isn’t the wide fronto-parietal network emphasized in previous studies, but are primarily localized to a more restricted temporo-parietal-occipital hot zone.</li>\n<li>Some cortical areas are close to qualifying as content-specific NCC.</li>\n<li>E.g. Fusiform face area.</li>\n<li>The danger of relying too heavily on correlative evidence to identify the NCC: due to the intricate connectivity of the brain, activity in the prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum can covary with conscious perception without being responsible for it.</li>\n<li>It remains unclear whether neurons within primary sensory areas contribute to the content-specific NCC.</li>\n<li>In short, no single brain area seems necessary for being conscious.</li>\n<li>A few areas are good candidates for both full and content-specific NCC.</li>\n<li>E.g. Posterior cortical hot zone.</li>\n<li>The NCC, by themselves, provide little information about consciousness in patients with severe brain damage, infants, fetuses, non-human species, and intelligent machines.</li>\n<li>Further progress in this field requires testable theories that address what consciousness is and what’s required of its physical substrate.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#cerebral-cortex-expansion-and-folding-what-have-we-learned\">Cerebral cortex expansion and folding: what have we learned?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#memory-retrieval-from-first-principles\">Memory Retrieval from First Principles</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#neuroscience-needs-behavior-correcting-a-reductionist-bias\">Neuroscience Needs Behavior: Correcting a Reductionist Bias</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#an-annotated-journey-through-modern-visual-neuroscience\">An Annotated Journey through Modern Visual Neuroscience</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#a-place-theory-of-sound-localization\">A place theory of sound localization</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#new-roles-for-synaptic-inhibition-in-sound-localization\">New roles for synaptic inhibition in sound localization</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#replay-of-cortical-spiking-sequences-during-human-memory-retrieval\">Replay of cortical spiking sequences during human memory retrieval</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#cortical-folding-scales-universally-with-surface-area-and-thickness-not-number-of-neurons\">Cortical folding scales universally with surface area and thickness, not number of neurons</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#curvature-as-a-feature-of-pattern-vision\">Curvature as a Feature of Pattern Vision</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#does-unconscious-perception-really-exist-continuing-the-assc20-debate\">Does unconscious perception really exist?
