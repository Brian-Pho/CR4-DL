Cognitive processes were interpreted as manipulating symbols according to certain rules.</li>\n<li>Two reasons to not use representations\n<ol>\n<li>It obscures our lack of understanding of how brains work and gives us the illusion that we do.</li>\n<li>It carries research away from more effective lines of inquiry.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>We have found that thinking of brain function in terms of representation impedes progress towards genuine understanding.</li>\n<li>E.g. EEG activity patterns in the olfactory bulb.</li>\n<li>We tried to say that each spatial pattern was like a snapshot that represents the odorant that’s correlated with it.

Many neurons are active together in a large population that generate similar signals for movement generation.</li>\n<li>Two types of movement\n<ul>\n<li>Reflexes</li>\n<li>Intentional/volitional action</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Volitional movement isn’t clearly defined nor understood, making it difficult to develop concrete, rigorous models to describe the way they work.</li>\n<li>Task-related neural activity can be correlated to movement, but the meaning of the association between any given neural pattern and the task will be open to debate.</li>\n<li>In contrast, reflexes are simpler to study in terms of input and output.</li>\n<li>Reflexive movements act on the principle of feedback where the output of the system is used to modify its input.</li>\n<li>E.g. Negative feedback where stretching a muscle causes it to be excited, causing the muscle to shorten and thus counteracting the stretch.</li>\n<li>E.g. Vestibular ocular reflex: head movement → semicircular canals → eye muscles. This reflex helps to stabilize movement with vision.</li>\n<li>Even these basic reflexes are modulated by the context in which they occur.</li>\n<li>Certain neural structures adjust the gain and sensitivity of receptors, thus modulating the reflex.</li>\n<li>Reflexes are effective during volitional movement and contribute to it’s successful production.</li>\n<li>Volitional movement: the intended execution of an action.</li>\n<li>A volitional movement can be broken down into a sequence of actions and intentions.</li>\n<li>Since intention must come before action, intention has to be predictive since sensory feedback isn’t available.</li>\n<li>Once sensory information is available, it may change the intention and action, suggesting that there are distinct phases of the task that may be controlled differently.</li>\n<li>Two phases hypothesis for volitional movement\n<ul>\n<li>An initial ballistic phase that transports the limb to a location near the target.</li>\n<li>A following homing phase executed with visual feedback as a series of small, fine movements.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How can movement take place in the absence of feedback?</li>\n<li>Results show that there’s a continuous specification of trajectory that begins before movement onset and continues as the arm moves.</li>\n<li>This control takes place even when continuous feedback is absent.</li>\n<li>One proposed solution is the efference copy.</li>\n<li>Efference copy: a copy of the motor command that isn’t sent to the muscles, but rather to sensory areas of the brain to predict the sensation that the movement results in.</li>\n<li>In its initial proposal, the efferent copy served to assign agency during eye movement, distinguishing moving visual scenes from self-generated motion.</li>\n<li>Findings suggest that “internal” recognition of a target error, such as using efferent copy, can lead to corrections without real-time feedback of the movement.</li>\n<li>If the target was shifted during a saccade, subjects could correct their trajectory quickly and smoothly, showing how extrinsic information can be incorporated into the ongoing movement generation process.</li>\n<li>This goes against the traditional ballistic phase of volitional movement as feedback is incorporated into the control of movement.</li>\n<li>This also shows that the signals used to control the arm’s trajectory are continuously transmitted throughout a reach.</li>\n<li>The efferent signal for a movement is modifiable by intrinsic errors and by extrinsic cues at the beginning of the movement and by target modifications.</li>\n<li>Both feedback and feedforward control are used to regulate movement.</li>\n<li>Modern feedforward control invokes learning, where the prediction of an intended action is modified by prior sensation.</li>\n<li>E.g. The motor system can progressively learn to estimate its own behavior and thus, modify it.</li>\n<li>Accurate prediction relies critically on accurate knowledge of the initial state of the system.</li>\n<li>The use of prior information before movement supports the idea that feedforward control systems are determined by their initial conditions.</li>\n<li>Internal model: prior knowledge gained by learning and used to make accurate predictions of an intended action.</li>\n<li>Internal models are an essential ingredient for forward-control theories.</li>\n<li>E.g.

You can’t be experiencing the color red if you’re in a coma or in non-REM sleep.</li>\n<li>Why does this dependency exist?</li>\n<li>Paper proposes that both the state and contents of consciousness depend on the activity of cortical layer 5 pyramidal (L5p) neurons.</li>\n<li>These neurons affect both cortical and thalamic processing, hence coupling the corticocortical loops and thalamocortical loops with each other.</li>\n<li>This coupling corresponds to the coupling between the state and contents of consciousness.</li>\n<li>Together, both loops form a thalamocortical broadcasting system where L5p cells are the central elements.</li>\n<li>A prediction of this theory is that cortical processes that don’t include L5p neurons will be unconscious. Thus, L5p neurons play a central role in the mechanisms underlying consciousness.</li>\n<li>Unfortunately for consciousness research, the state of consciousness is mostly studied separately from the contents.</li>\n<li>Research done on the state mainly explores the thalamus and the thalamocortical interactions, while research done on the contents is mostly focused on cortical processing.</li>\n<li>However, one basic fact about consciousness is that the state can never be dissociated from the contents.</li>\n<li>E.g. You can’t be conscious of the taste of coconut while being in an unconscious state and vice versa.</li>\n<li>So, the state and contents of consciousness make up an integrated whole; you can’t study one without assuming the other.</li>\n<li>It’s currently unclear why the state and contents of consciousness have to be so tightly coupled.</li>\n<li>This paper highlights a clear neurobiological correlate for this coupling, the cortical layer 5 pyramidal (L5p) neurons that participate in both thalamocortical and corticocortical loops, hence coupling these loops and thus functionally coupling the state and contents of consciousness.</li>\n<li>Thalamocortical loop and the state of consciousness\n<ul>\n<li>The idea that the thalamus plays a key role in controlling the state of consciousness isn’t new.</li>\n<li>Two general types of thalamocortical pathways\n<ul>\n<li>Specific pathway (SP): carries afferent information to the cortex.\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. Lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Non-specific pathway (NSP): has no direct role in transmitting information to the cortex, but is capable of modulating the cortex’s state.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>These two pathways are more intermingled than we thought so this is a simplified view.</li>\n<li>Evidence suggesting that the NSP thalamus is directly involved in controlling the state of consciousness\n<ul>\n<li>The alternation of sleep and wakefulness depends on NSPs.</li>\n<li>E.g. Simulation of the NSP ventromedial (VM) thalamic nucleus woke mice from NREM sleep and anesthesia.</li>\n<li>Virtually all general anesthetics have common targets in the NSP thalamus.</li>\n<li>Injuries and tumors localized to the NSP thalamus often cause absence of consciousness in patients despite the fact that the SP system remained intact.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Based on this evidence, there’s no specific area of the cortex that’s related to consciousness, but it’s the interplay with the thalamus that matters.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Corticocortical loop and the contents of consciousness\n<ul>\n<li>Many theories of consciousness have emphasized the relationship between consciousness and cortical processing.</li>\n<li>E.g. Global workspace theory.</li>\n<li>However, this focus on the contents of consciousness in humans has left unanswered why these contents of consciousness are dependent on the state of consciousness.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>State and contents of consciousness interact in L5p neurons\n<ul>\n<li>Paper proposes that L5p neurons functionally correspond to the connection between the state and contents of consciousness.</li>\n<li>Thalamocortical and corticocortical loops uniquely intersect at the level of L5p neurons.</li>\n<li>Cortical L5p neurons have two functionally distinct sites of integration\n<ul>\n<li>Soma/Dendrite: receives specific feedforward information from lower cortical areas.</li>\n<li>Apical: receives diverse input from higher cortical areas and NSP thalamic nuclei.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If both sites are depolarized at around the same time, the chance that the neuron fires is greatly increased.</li>\n<li>E.g. The secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) can be activated by L5p neurons in S1 through the NSP thalamus.</li>\n<li>This suggests that the transthalamic pathway is a key component for cortical activity propagation.</li>\n<li>Studies suggest that the awake state has an enormous impact on the activity of L5p apical dendrites.</li>\n<li>The massive increase in the activity duration of L5p apical dendrites may reflect the interaction between the state and contents of consciousness.</li>\n<li>L5p neurons may also be vital for conscious perception.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Non-conscious contents in a conscious state\n<ul>\n<li>If the state and contents of consciousness are bound in the brain, then how can some processing of the contents be unconscious?</li>\n<li>In other words, why does unconscious processing exist?</li>\n<li>Not all sensory signals are consciously experienced.</li>\n<li>E.g. Peripheral vision and priming effects.</li>\n<li>In fact, consciousness only has access to very specific levels of representation.</li>\n<li>E.g. We don’t have access to the processes that segregate our environment into discrete objects nor can we access how colors are perceived.</li>\n<li>Hence, conscious experience is restricted to certain contents and computations.</li>\n<li>The theory presented in this paper has a natural way to understand this: all subcortical and cortical processing that doesn’t involve L5p neurons will remain non-conscious.</li>\n<li>E.g. Motor control depends on the computations of the basal ganglia and cerebellum, which are detached from the loop of consciousness.</li>\n<li>Non-conscious processing also happens in the cortex.</li>\n<li>We make the strong prediction that cortical processing in itself, when it isn’t integrated with NSP thalamic nuclei via L5p neurons, is unconscious.</li>\n<li>Specifically, feedforward cortical processing that bypasses thalamocortical neurons is non-conscious.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Thalamocortical broadcasting in action\n<ul>\n<li>It’s well known that conscious experience has a limited temporal resolution.</li>\n<li>If different stimuli are presented too quickly, then some fail to be consciously experienced.</li>\n<li>E.g. Backward masking, attentional blink, and if two colors are quickly cycled, then they fuse into a single color such as red and green turning into yellow.</li>\n<li>This is explained by the L5p neuron theory that if conscious perception is based on the processing within the thalamocortical loop, then it’s hard for conscious perception to resolve anything that happens faster than the processing time of this loop.</li>\n<li>Thus, we claim that the temporal resolution of conscious experience is caused/limited by the propagation time between L5p neurons, NSP thalamus, and higher cortical areas.</li>\n<li>We can explain the backward masking phenomenon with this theory.</li>\n<li>E.g. When the first stimulus (target) activates the L5p neurons, it starts the thalamocortical broadcasting loop. However, by the time this activity propagates from the L5p neurons to the NSP thalamus and back to the apical dendrites of L5p neurons, the second stimulus (mask) has taken over early cortical representations and now steals/blocks the neurons that the first stimulus was going to use.

M cones peak near 530 nm and L come peak near 560 nm, so unique yellow should be somewhere in-between when both M and L respond the same amount, around 545 nm. - It should be noted, though, that color and wavelength are not the same. - So, if the weighting were one, then theoretically unique yellow should be near 545 nm. - However, the average value of unique yellow is 578 nm in normal people, indicating that the input of the L cone to the red/green chromatic channel has been adjusted, reducing it’s sensitivity by a gain factor of 0.64. - What explains this gain factor? - One possible answer is that M cones absorb fewer photons compared to L cones, about six to seven photons for every ten absorbed by L cones. - So, we hypothesize that the normalization mechanism that adjusts the relative gain of L and M cones is due do the difference in absorption of photons. Thus, we predict a compensating reduction in the relative weighting for the L cone input by 0.60-0.70, just as observed. - With the experiments above, we see a change in gain of about plus/minus 10%, showing that a plastic neural mechanism controls the gain.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 634px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/8eaa67f74682700657bf5b62b239382b/374ac/figure4-10.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 293.6%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Figure 4\"\n        title=\"Figure 4\"\n        src=\"/static/8eaa67f74682700657bf5b62b239382b/374ac/figure4-10.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8eaa67f74682700657bf5b62b239382b/63868/figure4-10.png 250w,\n/static/8eaa67f74682700657bf5b62b239382b/0b533/figure4-10.png 500w,\n/static/8eaa67f74682700657bf5b62b239382b/374ac/figure4-10.png 634w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span> - How about over the long term? - We can study congenital color blind people to see the effects of color vision deficiency over a lifetime of abnormal input. - Results suggest that the gain adjustment is near the theoretical limit in color blind people and it’s possible the gain mechanism is fully adjustable and could be set to any value dictated by the environment. - Interestingly for one of the color blind subjects, if the L cone gain wasn’t altered from the average normal person, his unique yellow would occur at a wavelength beyond 700 nm, a wavelength outside of the visible range. - One might argue that through shared culture/language, it’s possible that people with significantly different color perception might come to agree on a consistent set of color terms. - However, these experiments show that altered experiences, through the use of colored filters, change the wavelength called unique yellow, which shows that anomalous observers give different values for unique yellow even though they’re subjected to the same cultural influences.</li>\n<li>The flexibility of the color vision system is shown by it’s ability to adjust to different chromatic environments, to correct for large differences in cone ratio, and to maximize color vision in anomalous trichromats.</li>\n<li>Two types of color adaptation\n<ul>\n<li>One is fast and largely retinal in which the visual system adjusts to the ambient illumination levels.

All brain areas should have no activity.</li>\n<li>Thus, if the uniform state is compared to the resting state, we find the DMN.</li>\n<li>What is the function of the default mode network?</li>\n<li>We can start by associating each brain region of the DMN with it’s known behavior/function.</li>\n<li>The DMN is roughly divided into three major subdivisions\n<ul>\n<li>Ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPC)\n<ul>\n<li>Is a critical element in a network of areas that receive sensory information from the external world and body, and conveys this information to structures such as the hypothalamus, amygdala, and periaqueductal gray matter.</li>\n<li>Seems to be important in personality and social behavior.</li>\n<li>Is the same area that was damaged in Phineas Gauge.</li>\n<li>The emotional state of a person has a direct effect on the activity level in the VMPC component of the DMN.</li>\n<li>E.g. Anxiety level while performing the task. Decreasing anxiety followed decreasing activity in the VMPC.</li>\n<li>Taken together, this suggests that the VMPC component of the DMN reflects a dynamic balance between focused attention and a subject’s emotional state.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (DMPC)\n<ul>\n<li>Is distinguished from the VMPC by its association with self-referential judgments.</li>\n<li>E.g.

Daydreaming, mind wandering, nostalgia, self-reflection, or internal thoughts.</li>\n<li>Furthermore, spontaneous cognition usually involves thoughts about one’s personal past and future, which fits with the identified functionality of the DMN in humans.</li>\n<li>However, there may be more to the DMN if we look beyond spontaneous cognition.</li>\n<li>First is that spontaneous activity, which may not be the same as spontaneous cognition, is the major factor contributing to the high energy cost of brain functions in humans.</li>\n<li>E.g. Brains are 5% of our body weight but use 20% of the body’s energy budget.</li>\n<li>Also weird is that the additional energy associated with task-evoked changes in the brain are small, usually less than 5% locally.</li>\n<li>Across mammalian species, the DMN is kind of similar, but also kind of different, due to different neuroanatomy.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1000px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/4f689f357f92bb6a653d47f37373706f/21482/figure3-12.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 51.6%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Figure 3\"\n        title=\"Figure 3\"\n        src=\"/static/4f689f357f92bb6a653d47f37373706f/00d43/figure3-12.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/4f689f357f92bb6a653d47f37373706f/63868/figure3-12.png 250w,\n/static/4f689f357f92bb6a653d47f37373706f/0b533/figure3-12.png 500w,\n/static/4f689f357f92bb6a653d47f37373706f/00d43/figure3-12.png 1000w,\n/static/4f689f357f92bb6a653d47f37373706f/21482/figure3-12.png 1350w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></li>\n<li>Patterns of resting-state functional connectivity appear to transcend levels of consciousness as they’re present in humans under anesthesia, monkeys, rats, and during the early stages of sleep in humans.</li>\n<li>This makes it unlikely that the patterns and intrinsic activity they represent are primarily the result of unconstrained, conscious cognition (mind wandering or daydreaming).</li>\n<li>Two examples of functional balance between the DMN and other brain systems\n<ul>\n<li>The dorsal attention network (DAN) and the DMN appear to be anticorrelated as increases in DAN is accompanied by decreases in DMN.

fibers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What’s a useful description of the retinal code?</li>\n<li>We can start by asking: how many levels of gray can the retina distinguish between?</li>\n<li>To experimentally test this, we can project a uniform gray field onto the retina, record the spike train, then vary the light intensity and see how small the steps can be that still cause a difference in neural firing.</li>\n<li>Results show that after an intensity step, ganglion cells fires a brief burst of spikes and then returns back to what it was doing before the step.</li>\n<li>Something similar happens for almost every other ganglion cell, so we conclude that steady gray levels are almost indistinguishable.</li>\n<li>If we flicker the gray levels, either at very slow or very fast frequencies, then there’s no response.</li>\n<li>So, the initial question can’t be answered without specifying the time course of the light intensity.</li>\n<li>We also find that even when presenting the same stimulus repeatedly, ganglion cells produce somewhat different spike trains, and this variability limits the ability to discriminate two different stimuli.</li>\n<li>What aspect of the spike train should we measure as the “response”?</li>\n<li>E.g. Number of spikes in some time window? Time of arrival of every spike? Population spiking?</li>\n<li>Final results show that the relationship between gray levels and firing isn’t permanent and static, but varies considerably depending on the recent history of the visual stimulus.</li>\n<li>Four specifications of a neural code\n<ol>\n<li>The relevant measure of neural activity in the ganglion cell population.</li>\n<li>How this activity responds to any given visual stimulus.</li>\n<li>The precision of this response.</li>\n<li>The degree of plasticity in this relationship between stimulus and response.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>If we compare the eye across different species, we find similarities and differences.</li>\n<li>Differences because different animals use their visual system for different tasks, but the structure of the retina is remarkably conserved from fish to primates.</li>\n<li>E.g. Same three-layered arrangement, same five principle cell types, same neurotransmitters, same anatomical micro-circuitry.</li>\n<li>One explanation for all of these similarities is that the retina is adapted to deal with constraints that are shared among all species.</li>\n<li>Many principles of retinal signaling seem to be remarkably conserved.</li>\n<li>We can generalize findings from single-cell recordings to the population if\n<ul>\n<li>The population can be divided into groups/classes and each cell is representative of its group. In other words, we assume that the population is mostly homogeneous and that each cell isn’t unique.</li>\n<li>The firing of each neuron in the population depends only on the stimulus, and not on the activity of other neurons in the population.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The second condition isn’t always fulfilled but even still, single-cell recordings still provide valuable information.</li>\n<li>The important response feature in the spike train of a single ganglion cell is taken to be the neuron’s instantaneous firing probability at various times throughout the stimulus presentation.</li>\n<li>It’s often assumed that the brain, instead, estimates this response function by counting spikes from many identical ganglion cells.</li>\n<li>The central problem of the retinal code is how a ganglion cell’s firing rate depends on visual stimulation.</li>\n<li>Review of ON, OFF, and ON/OFF ganglion cells.</li>\n<li>Two aspects of retinal processing\n<ul>\n<li>Lateral inhibition in space\n<ul>\n<li>Because of the antagonistic action of the center and surround regions of the receptive field, ganglion cells respond strongly to stimuli whose intensity varies in space over the receptive field.</li>\n<li>E.g. When the center and surround are illuminated differently.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Differentiation in time\n<ul>\n<li>Because the response to a light step lasts only a short period of time, many ganglion cells seem to emphasize stimuli that change in time over static ones.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In general, we view a ganglion cell’s firing rate as a function of the stimulus.</li>\n<li>Spatiotemporal integration model\n<ul>\n<li>This model proposes that the function from stimulus to firing rate is a cascade of a few simple transformations of the stimulus.</li>\n<li>First, the stimulus is summed over all space, with some weighting function. Then, the resulting signal is passed through a filter with some impulse response and the result is added to the baseline firing rate. Negative baseline rates of the resulting firing rate are truncated to zero.</li>\n<li>E.g. A white bar moving across the retina can be decomposed into many small flashed spots.

Average/mean light level for light adaptation.</li>\n<li>The most significant effect of decreasing the mean light level is an increase in the sensitivity of retinal ganglion cells.</li>\n<li>E.g. If the background is dim, the flash intensity required to elicit a response is lower than for a bright background.</li>\n<li>This threshold flash intensity is proportional to the mean light level.</li>\n<li>This is an application of the Weber-Fechner law of adaption where the retina produces approximately the same response for two visual displays that are related by a simple proportional scaling of all intensity values.</li>\n<li>This has uses in signaling information that’s illumination invariant as the relative ratios of intensities receives from different parts of the scene are approximately independent of the illuminant.</li>\n<li>Through the process of light adaptation, the retina encodes the invariant features of objects and mostly discards information about absolute light level, except for the receptors that drive the pupillary reflex.</li>\n<li>In dim light, not only are ganglion cells more sensitive, they’re also slower as brief flashes produce a burst of spikes with longer latency and longer duration than normal.</li>\n<li>This means that ganglion cells integrate the visual input over a longer time interval before reporting it to the brain and this may be done to reduce noise under conditions where the signal is small.</li>\n<li>However, this comes at the cost of impaired time resolution.</li>\n<li>Also in dim light, ganglion cells alter their spatial integration by losing their antagonistic surround region and as a result, their receptive field expands at the cost of spatial resolution.</li>\n<li>Together, it appears that retinal processing largely accounts for the perceptual effects of light adaptation.</li>\n<li>This adjustment is remarkably fast, happening within a few tenths of a second after a change in background intensity.</li>\n<li>Three mechanisms of light adaptation\n<ul>\n<li>Individual photoreceptors adapt and become more sensitive and slower in dim light.</li>\n<li>In dim light, the retinal circuitry switches from cones to rods as the primary input receptors.</li>\n<li>Circuits postsynaptic to the receptor cells also change their sensitivity during light adaptation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>All of these effects of light adaptation can be viewed as a modulation of the stimulus-response relationship controlled by the mean light level.</li>\n<li>New aspects of retinal signaling - Ganglion cells aren’t independent channels of information. - Spike trains from retinal ganglion cells can be very precise and reliable. - Rapid intensity transients appear to be a key stimulus feature for triggering precisely timed spikes. - Instead of firing rate conveying stimulus information, it appears that the time of its first spike and the total number of spikes in the event conveys it.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

proposes that memories are encoded in hippocampal-neocortical networks, but that each reactivation results in a different trace in the hippocampus.</li>\n<li>Hippocampal-traces are assumed to be contextual, while cortical-traces are assumed to be semantic and context-free.</li>\n<li>So, retrieval of remote semantic memories doesn’t require the hippocampus, but retrieval of remote episodic

loss of memories.</li>\n<li>Multiple studies have seen that the RA gradient was temporally graded (meaning older memories weren’t forgotten), flat, or dependent on the size of the lesion.</li>\n<li>A recent survey on rodents with amnesia provides overwhelming support for flat RA gradients, which argues against SMSC.</li>\n<li>However, the survey also argues against MTT since partial hippocampal damage doesn’t lead to a temporal RA gradient.</li>\n<li>The debate is complicated by the inconsistency of results across studies of different amnesic patients.</li>\n<li>Evidence from amnesia on the RA gradient is not entirely conclusive, and provides only partial and sometimes conflicting support for the two major memory theories.</li>\n<li>Another theory is the hippocampal memory indexing theory.</li>\n<li>Hippocampal Memory Indexing Theory\n<ul>\n<li>Goal is to explain the nature of the hippocampus and it’s involvement in encoding and retrieving memory traces.</li>\n<li>Two important realizations\n<ul>\n<li>There appears to be multiple neural networks capable of supporting memory.</li>\n<li>The neocortex itself was found to be sufficient to support some aspects of memory.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>This theory proposes that when a memory trace is encoded, inputs from cortical sensory regions activate a small population of hippocampal synapses, which in turn, activate a network of neocortical regions.</li>\n<li>And as the memory is consolidated, the connections between the hippocampus and neocortex are strengthened.</li>\n<li>Thus, a memory trace is hippocampal-neocortical connections.</li>\n<li>The hippocampus plays a critical role in memory retrieval as the activation of a small subset of neocortical regions, part of a larger pattern comprising a consolidated memory trace, can signal to the hippocampus to re-instantiate the full pattern despite partial or degraded input.</li>\n<li>This explains how certain aspects or contextual details of an event can lead to recall of other related details such as the entire event.</li>\n<li>It’s important to note that the hippocampus doesn’t store details about an event per se, but rather acts as an index.</li>\n<li>An analogy is that of a library. If memories are like books, then retrieving an experience means to access different books in such library. The librarian, or hippocampus, hasn’t stored the knowledge contained in the library, but it can point to the correct locations where this knowledge can be retrieved.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Competitive trace theory (CTT): an alternative theory to SMSC and MTT within the framework of indexing theory. - The main difference between episodic and semantic memories is that the former refers to memories with rich contextual details that the latter lacks. - Another important note is that the accuracy of a memory isn’t related to successfully retrieving it. - Episodic in this theory refers to the phenomenological experience of contextual recollection and not in reference to the accuracy of the memory. - Semantic in this theory refers to the accurate knowledge that builds up over time through repetition. - Three critical assumptions - Memories are most episodic and veridical at the moment they’re first encoded. - With every subsequent reactivation, a memory can become less episodic and accurate details can be replaced with illusory details. - Central features of experiences become simultaneously consolidated and decontextualized (lost) over time. - How does this occur? - We suggest that when a memory is reactivated/retrieved by an internal or external cue, the hippocampus acts to re-instantiate the neural signature of the original memory trace. - To do so, the hippocampus recombines the central elements of the original memory trace and reactivates them. - Unlike previous theories, we propose that this process potentially adds or subtracts individual contextual features, resulting in a slightly altered version of the memory. - This altered memory is now capable of being stored as a new memory trace and undergoes the same storage process as the original memory. - This differs from MTT because memories aren’t stored in parallel, but rather compete for representation in the neocortex, and that the hippocampus isn’t the site of trace storage, but rather links the individual components of a neocortical memory. - Furthermore, neocortical traces themselves become devoid of context with increasing reactivations. - Two distinct phenomena - Consolidation: overlapping features in memories shouldn’t compete for representation and are strengthened in a Hebbian fashion. A result of repeated activations is that overlapping features have a higher chance of being retrieved with high fidelity. - Decontextualization: nonoverlapping features in memories compete with each other and are mutually inhibited in an anti-Hebbian fashion. - It follows that the retrieval of remote memories appears episodic and contextual because the hippocampus reconstructs and re-encodes, rather than reactivates. - Without the hippocampus (as in amnesia), the only retrievable memories are the high fidelity semantic representations in the neocortex.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

This simultaneously leads to consolidation of semantic memory in the neocortex and loss of episodic details.</li>\n<li>Accurate episodic details are only available in very recent memories. As memories get older, these details are replaced by recontextualized details stored by the hippocampus that give rise to illusory memories that become more prevalent as the age of the memory increases.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>CTT is also consistent with the Distributed Reinstatement Theory which argues that the frequency of replay/re-encoding, rather than the passage of time, leads to memories becoming independent of the hippocampus.</li>\n<li>The notion of competition for representation isn’t unique to just memory, but also seems to be a general principle of cortical operation.</li>\n<li>E.g.

It also explains why fictitious details are included over time instead of a smooth degradation in accuracy.</li>\n<li>The data from human amnesiacs can’t be used as strong support for CTT or any other model given the disagreements about it’s quality, quantity, accuracy, and neuroanatomical damage.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>MTT proposes that retrieval is dependent on the hippocampus because it’s required to reconstruct the memory of the episode within a spatial scaffold.</li>\n<li>CTT proposes that any context can be consolidated and strengthened to become independent of the hippocampus, as long as it’s overlapping and not interfering with prior exposure.</li>\n<li>New predictions from CTT\n<ul>\n<li>Remote episodic memories should be less accurate than recent episodic memories.</li>\n<li>Amnesia patient should have more accurate remote semantic memories compared to healthy controls, as CTT argues that the hippocampus distorts a memory every time it’s recalled.</li>\n<li>A flat or graded RA curve will depend on whether contextual information was repeatedly presented.

When a memory is recalled often, it’ll more rapidly become stored in the cortex, becoming less episodic but more independent of the hippocampus.</li>\n<li>Older memories might be recalled more often, but the relationship isn’t perfect, which would explain why one amnesiac’s memory impairment extends back forty years, while another’s extend back only ten years.</li>\n<li>With each memory recall, some features are reinforced while others disappear, explaining why memories get fuzzy over time. As details are lost, they become less episodic and more semantic.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"consciousness-and-the-brainstem\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#consciousness-and-the-brainstem\" aria-label=\"consciousness and the brainstem permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0010-0277(00)00127-X\">Consciousness and the brainstem</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Two lines of evidence linking consciousness and the brainstem\n<ol>\n<li>Damage to the upper brainstem causes coma and persistent vegetative state.</li>\n<li>Lesions or electrical stimulation of a part of the brainstem, the reticular formation, is associated with the electrophysiological pattern commonly found in wakeful and attentive states.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Link between consciousness and the brainstem\n<ul>\n<li>Brainstem has the reticular formation → Engagement of the ascending reticular activating system activates the cerebral cortex → Activating the cortex underlies wakefulness and attention → Wakefulness and attention constitute consciousness.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We know the brainstem regulates life by controlling our bodily functions, but the link between it and consciousness hasn’t been proposed before.</li>\n<li>Object: entities as diverse as a person, place, melody, emotional state.</li>\n<li>Image: a mental pattern of any of the sensory modalities.</li>\n<li>Two problems with consciousness\n<ul>\n<li>How does the brain create the experience of an object?\n<ul>\n<li>How’s the movie in the brain generated?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How does the brain create a sense of self in the act of knowing?\n<ul>\n<li>How the brain generates the sense that there’s an owner and observer for that movie?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The second problem is nested within the former; how the appearance of an owner and observer materialize within the movie.</li>\n<li>Paper’s proposed answer\n<ul>\n<li>Core consciousness: when the brain’s representation devices generate an imaged, nonverbal account of how the organism’s own state is affected by the organism’s interaction with an object, and when this process leads to the enhancement of the image.</li>\n<li>Assumptions\n<ul>\n<li>That the organism is mapped in the organism’s brain in first-order maps.</li>\n<li>That changes to such first-order maps, due to objects/stimuli, cause changes to the maps pertaining to the organism.</li>\n<li>That such changes can be mapped to second-order maps, which represent the overall relationships between object and organism.</li>\n<li>That neural patterns formed in second-order maps become mental images, the same goes for first-order maps, thus producing an image of the relationships between organism and object.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Proto-self: the first-order collection of neural patterns which map, moment by moment, the state of the organism in its many dimensions.</li>\n<li>The proto-self isn’t the sense of self in the traditional sense because it doesn’t know that it knows; it just knows.</li>\n<li>Instead, the proto-self is used as a foundation for which both the core and autobiographical self are built on.</li>\n<li>Structures of the proto-self\n<ul>\n<li>Several brainstem nuclei that regulate body states and map body signals.</li>\n<li>Hypothalamus and basal forebrain.</li>\n<li>Insular cortex, medial parietal cortices, and somatosensory cortices.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The mapping of organism and object occurs in first-order neural maps representing the proto-self and object.</li>\n<li>However, accounting for the causal relationships between object and organism occurs in second-order neural maps.</li>\n<li>Structures of second-order maps\n<ul>\n<li>Cingulate cortices</li>\n<li>Thalamus</li>\n<li>Superior colliculi</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The hypothesis pivots on the relationships between the changing organism’s state and the sensorimotor maps of a given object that cause those changes.</li>\n<li>As the images of the object affect the state of the organism, another level of brain structures creates a nonverbal account of the events that are taking place as a consequence of the object-organism interaction.</li>\n<li>We propose that the essence of consciousness is a continuously generated image of the act of knowing relative to the mental images of the object to be known.
