Total neuron numbers, total glia numbers, and the ratio of glia to neurons (GNR).</li>\n<li>Brain cell counting can be roughly divided into three historical phases.</li>\n<li>The first phase was collecting data only for parts of the human brain, specifically the cerebral cortex.</li>\n<li>The second phase was serious estimates of total numbers for both glia and neurons.</li>\n<li>Even though these cell density-based estimates supported a total GNR of about 1:1, this was either not recognized or not communicated properly as major textbooks and reviews cited GNRs of 10:1 or 50:1.</li>\n<li>This would remain unchallenged from the 1960s until 2009.</li>\n<li>The third and most recent phase began with the study by Azedvedo et al. in 2009 that revealed the discrepancy between textbook knowledge and the published literature.</li>\n<li>Surprisingly, the idea of one trillion glia wasn’t due to technical disadvantages or counting methods, but rather the failure to notice that published numbers for all three components: neuron counts, glia counts, and GNR, contradicted each other.</li>\n<li>In cell counting, the unit being counted is the cell body with its nucleus.</li>\n<li>For glia, most studies combine astrocyte, oligodendrocyte, and microglia counts.</li>\n<li>Three types of cell counting methods\n<ol>\n<li>Model-based or design-based counting of stained cells, nuclei, or nucleoli (histology/stereology).\n<ol>\n<li>Tissues are fixed, usually in a formaldehyde-based fixative, embedded in a suitable medium, sectioned into thin slices, stained with a dye, and cells counted under a microscope.</li>\n<li>Model-based approaches rely on analyzing thin sections and extrapolating, while design-based approaches use thicker sections and applies a random sampling scheme to count.</li>\n<li>Both methods can result in inaccuracies due to assumptions so they should be calibrated against the ultimate standard: 3D serial section reconstructions of an entire region or sample.</li>\n<li>Major challenges: ensure samples are truly representative of the reference volume, prevent double counting of particles that appear in multiple sections, account for shrinkage due to age and tissue changes, distinguish between neurons and glia.</li>\n<li>The importance of counting absolute cell numbers rather than cell densities was underscored by the finding that tissues shrink differently with age.</li>\n<li>E.g. Neglecting this finding led to the false belief that neuron numbers declines steadily and significantly during normal aging.</li>\n<li>This type of cell counting is valuable for well-defined regions but has limitations with larger tissues of heterogeneous composition.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>DNA extraction and measurement of total DNA content.\n<ol>\n<li>Extracts and measures DNA content to calculate cell numbers based on knowledge of DNA content per cell nucleus.</li>\n<li>Major challenges: complete recovery of DNA required, contamination with other nucleic acids, not all cells are euploid meaning their DNA content can vary.</li>\n<li>This technique was mostly used in the 1950s-70s to obtain relative comparisons rather than absolute numbers.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Direct enumeration of cells in homogenized brain tissue (isotropic fractionator).\n<ol>\n<li>Dissected chilled tissue was weighed, homogenized by mixing, diluted in a known volume of medium, stained with methylene blue, mixed, and then aliquots of the diluted medium were counted on a hemocytometer.</li>\n<li>Major challenges: rapid degradation of unfixed cells, lack of distinction between cell types, rupturing of cells during mechanical disintegration (mixing).</li>\n<li>This method is easy, fast, and accurate, generating estimates of cell numbers independent of tissue volume or cell density.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1000px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/CR4-DL/static/08ce3b404921180b183b6ea4572520aa/e8d6f/figure2-1.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 64.4%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Figure 2\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/CR4-DL/static/08ce3b404921180b183b6ea4572520aa/00d43/figure2-1.png\"\n        srcset=\"/CR4-DL/static/08ce3b404921180b183b6ea4572520aa/63868/figure2-1.png 250w,\n/CR4-DL/static/08ce3b404921180b183b6ea4572520aa/0b533/figure2-1.png 500w,\n/CR4-DL/static/08ce3b404921180b183b6ea4572520aa/00d43/figure2-1.png 1000w,\n/CR4-DL/static/08ce3b404921180b183b6ea4572520aa/e8d6f/figure2-1.png 1273w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span>\n4. Studies indicate equivalency between the isotopic fractionator (IF) and stereology.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Considering the results obtained from different investigators using different methods, most of the data are relatively consistent.</li>\n<li>E.g. The majority of studies estimated total neuron numbers for the entire cerebral cortex to be between 10-20 billion.</li>\n<li>Since the cerebral cortex takes up 80-85% of the adult human brain volume, it was often equated with the whole brain, leading to oversimplification and the myth of one trillion glia.</li>\n<li>Three major components of the human brain\n<ul>\n<li>Cerebral cortex (80-85% volume)\n<ul>\n<li>There’s been confusion on whether cerebral cortex means only gray matter or gray and white matter.</li>\n<li>The majority of studies excluded white matter.</li>\n<li>The number of neurons in white matter is relatively small so excluding it doesn’t make a significant difference for total cell numbers.</li>\n<li>Some studies were ambiguous in whether their estimates applied to one or both hemispheres.</li>\n<li>Another source of error is that counting only 100-200 neurons is sufficient for extrapolation. Recent computer simulations suggest that considerably more neurons should be counted.</li>\n<li>The majority of histology-derived estimates converge at 10-20 billion neurons, consistent with the IF.</li>\n<li>The notion that large numbers of neurons (30-50%) are lost during decades of normal human aging have been refuted.</li>\n<li>Actual losses appear to be on much smaller scales and are more region-specific.</li>\n<li>The GNR of 1.5 in gray matter of the adult human cortex was confirmed by numerous subsequent investigations.</li>\n<li>The GNR varies locally in gray matter between 1.2 in occipital and 3.6 in frontal areas.</li>\n<li>One of the major, if not most serious, problems with histology-based counting methods is the technical difficulty of recognizing glia and distinguishing them from small neurons.</li>\n<li>To this day, we still haven’t found a solution.</li>\n<li>Therefore, the design of methods that can accurately distinguish neurons from glia is important.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Cerebellum (10% volume)\n<ul>\n<li>In the cerebellum, a large number of neurons and low number of non-neuronal cells had been suspected by early investigators.</li>\n<li>The GNR for the entire human cerebellum appears to be about 0.05.</li>\n<li>The unusual cellular composition of the cerebellum was a key factor in failed attempts to calculate the true GNR for the total human brain and a major reason behind the one trillion glia myth.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Remaining (2-8% volume)\n<ul>\n<li>Until 2009, there had been no attempts to estimate the total number of neurons or glia in this part of the brain.</li>\n<li>The total number of neurons and glia in the brainstem, diencephalon, and striatum doesn’t add up to the numbers even close to those in the cerebral cortex or cerebellum.</li>\n<li>This is in part due to it’s small volume.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Our current best estimate for the cellular composition of the entire human brain is between 67-86 billion neurons and around 40-50 billion glia.</li>\n<li>The GNR is important because it informs us about brain development, physiology, diseases, aging, and brain evolution.</li>\n<li>E.g. Comparing brain regions.</li>\n<li>No notes on the history of the GNR.</li>\n<li>Differences in GNR across species are largely determined by changes in neuronal densities rather than changes in glia densities.</li>\n<li>Small neurons are difficult to distinguish from glia.</li>\n<li>A breakthrough seemed to have been achieved by using an antibody against a neuron-specific nuclear antigen (NeuN).</li>\n<li>Remarkably, errors in neuron number, glia number, and GNR, were in the most prestigious neuroscience textbook: The Principles of Neuroscience.</li>\n<li>The lack of citations for the 10:1 GNR over a 50-year period is an example of a major failure in the scientific process that’s supposed to self-correct invalid claims or reports.</li>\n<li>Why should we care about cell counting?</li>\n<li>Three examples of how cell counting has had a significant impact\n<ol>\n<li>Aging human brain\n<ul>\n<li>Is there a significant loss of neurons in the normal aging brain?</li>\n<li>Studies from the 1950-1980 reported and generally believed that the normal aging brain loses large numbers of neurons each day after age 30.</li>\n<li>E.g. A 60-year-old would have half as many cerebral neurons as what they had started with.</li>\n<li>However, we now know that the shrinkage of brains after fixation depends on age and that the reference volumes of brains from older people different from younger people.</li>\n<li>When this is controlled for, there was very little, if any, normal loss of neurons in most parts of the brian.</li>\n<li>This myth had found its way into textbooks, curricula, and common knowledge, making it difficult to correct.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Evolution of the brain\n<ul>\n<li>Throughout the 20th century, the prevailing notion was that the human brain had an exceptional cellular composition among species, which was responsible for the superior cognitive abilities of humans.</li>\n<li>E.g. Previous work suggested that the human neocortex showed an abnormally high GNR when compared with other mammals.</li>\n<li>However, the development of more efficient cell counting methods such as the IF made it possible to re-examine this claim.</li>\n<li>Instead, we find that the GNR is highly conserved between structures and species, suggesting an important and close regulation of glia numbers in response to neuron density and size.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Developmental neuroscience\n<ul>\n<li>Neuron and glia numbers and their ratios fluctuate in relatively narrow ranges, even in different species and different brain structures, suggesting an optimal relationship between cell types.</li>\n<li>How are these ratios achieved and maintained during development?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The assumption that the distribution of glia in one small part of the brain was representative for the whole brain likely contributed to the widely overstated GNR in reviews and textbooks.</li>\n<li>Reasons behind the perpetuation of the claim of one trillion cells in the human brain\n<ul>\n<li>Failure to realize that the number of neurons and glia didn’t add up</li>\n<li>Focus on parts of the human brain that weren’t representative</li>\n<li>Neglecting the role of the cerebellum</li>\n<li>Missing primary literature</li>\n<li>Copying information from previous reviews without scrutiny</li>\n<li>Inaccurate quoting of others’ work</li>\n<li>Hesitation to challenge the prevailing dogma</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A precise balance of glia to neurons in human brain regions seems essential for normal functioning and this balance is disturbed in disease and trauma.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"the-big-data-problem-turning-maps-into-knowledge\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-big-data-problem-turning-maps-into-knowledge\" aria-label=\"the big data problem turning maps into knowledge permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2014.09.008\">The Big Data Problem: Turning Maps into Knowledge</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The ability to record from every neuron in the brain of an awake and behaving animal is unquestionably useful.</li>\n<li>Having a wiring diagram overlaid on such activity maps is probably a dream come true for most systems neuroscientists.</li>\n<li>However, the vast number of neurons in the brain results in enormous amounts of data.</li>\n<li>This paper argues that big data and the challenges associated with it (mining, storing, distributing) aren’t the key challenge we face in making neural maps useful.</li>\n<li>Instead, the author suggests that the essential ingredient is the experimental design used to gather and analyze such data.</li>\n<li>In essence, the hard work is in formulating the precise question that we want to know and what an answer would look like.</li>\n<li>Big data: any data that exceeds the size of a standard laptop hard drive.</li>\n<li>It’s important to distinguish between big data and complex data.</li>\n<li>Complex data: any data that’s complicated, hard to interpret, and hard to compress.</li>\n<li>Connectomics relies on recovering a circuit diagram by imaging the whole region of interest at the resolution of an electron microscope (EM).</li>\n<li>The size of raw connectomics data is truly daunting.</li>\n<li>E.g.

constant.</li>\n<li>To understand how these complicated phenomena interact to form the action potential and refractory period, we should obtain expressions relating the sodium and potassium conductances to time and membrane potential.</li>\n<li>While our experiments are unlikely to give any information about the nature of the molecular events underlying changes in permeability, our evidence does refute some theories while being consistent with others.</li>\n<li>The first important point is that the changes in membrane permeability appear to depend on membrane potential and not membrane current.</li>\n<li>E.g. If sodium concentration is higher or lower compared to the intracellular concentration, thus the driving force flips signs, the membrane current changes sign but still appears to follow the same time course.</li>\n<li>How might changes in the distribution of a charged particle affect the ease with which sodium ions cross the membrane?</li>\n<li>The first effect of depolarization is a movement of negatively charged molecules from the outside to the inside of the membrane resulting in an outward current.</li>\n<li>How do the negatively charged molecules cross the cell membrane?</li>\n<li>One hypothesis is that sodium ions cross the membrane in combination with a lipoid soluble carrier, allowing them to pass the cell lipid bilayer (membrane).</li>\n<li>Another hypothesis is that sodium movement depends on the distribution of charge particles that don’t act as carriers but allow sodium to pass through the membrane when they occupy particular sites in the membrane (with hindsight, this is the correct hypothesis).</li>\n<li>Much of what’s been said about changes in sodium permeability also apply to the change in potassium permeability.</li>\n<li>However, the potassium system differs from the sodium system in the following ways: the activating molecules have an affinity for potassium but not sodium, they move more slowly, and they aren’t blocked or inactivated.</li>\n<li>Another hypothesis is that only one system is present but that its selectivity changes soon after membrane depolarization.</li>\n<li>One of the most striking properties of the membrane is the extreme steepness of the relation between ionic conductance and membrane potential.</li>\n<li>Details of the mechanism will probably not be settled for some time, but it seems difficult to escape the conclusion that the changes in ionic permeability depend on the movement of some component of the membrane which behaves as though it has a large charge or dipole moment.</li>\n<li>No notes on the section “mathematical description of membrane current during a voltage clamp”.</li>\n<li>The discussion in the previous part shows that there’s little hope for calculating the time course of the sodium and potassium conductances from first principles since we don’t know how or why they change; we just know that they do change.</li>\n<li>Our goal here is to find equations that describe the conductances with reasonable accuracy and are sufficient for theoretical calculation of the action potential and refractory period.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1000px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/CR4-DL/static/8f9e2449746693c3b62286ca4a812ded/2dab4/figure17-3.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 52.800000000000004%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Figure 17\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/CR4-DL/static/8f9e2449746693c3b62286ca4a812ded/00d43/figure17-3.png\"\n        srcset=\"/CR4-DL/static/8f9e2449746693c3b62286ca4a812ded/63868/figure17-3.png 250w,\n/CR4-DL/static/8f9e2449746693c3b62286ca4a812ded/0b533/figure17-3.png 500w,\n/CR4-DL/static/8f9e2449746693c3b62286ca4a812ded/00d43/figure17-3.png 1000w,\n/CR4-DL/static/8f9e2449746693c3b62286ca4a812ded/2dab4/figure17-3.png 1461w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The rapid rise in voltage is due almost entirely to sodium conductance but after the peak, the potassium conductance takes a larger share.

In this year, Brodmann met Oskar Vogt who fascinated him about the future of brain research.</li>\n<li>Vogt finally convinced Brodmann to accept a position in Alexandersbad and to specialize in psychiatry and hypnosis.</li>\n<li>Brodmann went on to receive a postdoctoral position in the Neurobiological Central Station in Berlin.</li>\n<li>This station was founded by Vogt in 1901 and consisted of a medical practice for hypnosis, a research lab, and animal and photographic facilities.</li>\n<li>It was a completely private institution financially supported by the Krupp family and Vogt’s private income as a physician.</li>\n<li>It was here that Brodmann started his pioneering work on the cytoarchitecture of mammalian brains.</li>\n<li>From 1898 to 1900, Brodmann had planned to improve his experience in psychiatry and neuroanatomy.</li>\n<li>From 1901 onwards, Brodmann was an assistant at the neurobiological laboratory of the University of Berlin under Doctor O. Vogt until 1910 when Brodmann became an assistant physician of the Royal University Clinic for Mental and Nervous Conditions.</li>\n<li>The lab was important to Brodmann because it was the first time that he would be financially secure.</li>\n<li>The years between 1901 and 1910 were the period of Brodmann’s work on cytoarchitecture and localization, but his work wasn’t exclusively focused on cytoarchitecture.</li>\n<li>E.g. Brodmann published papers on hypnosis, astrocytes, neuropathology, psychopathology, polarization microscopy of myelinated nerve fibers, brain activity and blood flow, and hundreds of printed reviews other publications.</li>\n<li>Brodmann was a very critical reviewer and his reviews increased his number of opponents.</li>\n<li>His most influential studies are those on cytoarchitecture and the organization of the cerebral cortex.</li>\n<li>In a series of eight papers, Brodmann and his contemporary Campbell founded the field of cytoarchitectonic mapping.</li>\n<li>The commercial technology of the time was inadequate for Brodmann’s ambitious plans so they had to design and manufacture a large microtome themselves, improved embedding and staining procedures, created novel photographic techniques, and prepared complete series of sections of entire human hemispheres.</li>\n<li>Brodmann’s monograph from 1909 is a summary of his concept of cytoarchitecture and describes the principles of his comparative neuroanatomical approach.</li>\n<li>Brodmann’s six-layer concept of the cortex is universally accepted in modern studies and textbooks.</li>\n<li>Brodmann’s most important finding from comparative topography is that the cerebral cortex’s organization manifests a common architectonic plan in all mammals; a standard pattern of layers.</li>\n<li>The aim of his studies wasn’t to subdivide the cortex but to show that each cortical area has an evolutionary history.</li>\n<li>Brodmann wrote in his monograph: “Although my studies of localization are based on purely anatomical considerations … my ultimate goal was the achievement of a theory of function and its pathological deviations”.</li>\n<li>His search for functions of cytoarchitectonically defined areas led to the idea that single loci are active in different combinations when realizing a complex function.</li>\n<li>Brodmann revolutionized research on the microstructure of the human brain by establishing the common six-layered laminar bauplan and its regional modifications for the entire neocortex of mammals.</li>\n<li>One limitation of Brodmann’s maps is that he didn’t register the between-individual variability of the localization and size of areas.</li>\n<li>One fix for this is that cortical maps must be probabilistic as borders of cytoarchitectonic areas are highly variable between subjects.</li>\n<li>Another limitation is the observer-dependent definition of borders which has since been overcome with computerized image analysis.</li>\n<li>In 1908, Brodmann submitted his thesis to obtain a professorship position at the University of Berlin, which was rejected because of a dirty battle of office politics.</li>\n<li>In the end, Brodmann cancelled his position in Berlin and moved to the Clinic for Psychiatry and Neurology of the University Tubingen.</li>\n<li>In 1910, Brodmann was appointed as head of the anatomy lab.</li>\n<li>However, the beginning of World War I stopped all scientific plans and between 1914 and 1916, he served as a physician in a field hospital and took care of soldiers with brain injuries.</li>\n<li>Brodmann met his wife in 1917 (age 49) and had a daughter one year later.</li>\n<li>In 1918, Brodmann reached the climax of his career and was appointed as head of the Department for Topographical Anatomy in the famous Research Institute for Neurology in Munich.</li>\n<li>However, on August 22 1918, Brodmann suddenly died due to a devastating infection.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"structure-and-function-of-a-neocortical-synapse\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#structure-and-function-of-a-neocortical-synapse\" aria-label=\"structure and function of a neocortical synapse permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-03134-2\">Structure and function of a neocortical synapse</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We don’t know how the structure of a synapse relates to its physiological transmission strength, a key limitation for inferring brain function from neuronal wiring diagrams.</li>\n<li>This paper combines slice electrophysiology of connected pyramidal neurons in the mouse somatosensory cortex with correlated light microscopy and high-resolution electron microscopy of all synaptic contacts between the recorded neurons.</li>\n<li>We find a linear relationship between synapse size and strength, providing the missing link in assigning physiological weights to synapses.</li>\n<li>Previous studies of the frog neuromuscular junction revealed that synaptic transmission is probabilistic and follows binomial models with three parameters:\n<ul>\n<li>Number of neurotransmitter release sites</li>\n<li>Synaptic response to the release of one vesicle (quantum) of neurotransmitter</li>\n<li>Probability of a vesicle being released</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Synaptic strength is measured as the amplitude of the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) and is the product of the three parameters.</li>\n<li>Structurally, the area of the postsynaptic density (PSD) is proportional to its number of AMPA receptors and scales with the volume of the dendritic spine head.</li>\n<li>Whether and how the EPSP amplitude relates to PSD area remains unknown for any given synapse in the brain.</li>\n<li>Furthermore, it’s unclear whether individual neocortical synapses release more than one vesicle.</li>\n<li>Here we relate synaptic structure and function to determine the size-strength relationship and mode of vesicle release.</li>\n<li>We recorded EPSP amplitude and variance between connected layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons and identified all axodendritic contacts using both light microscopy and electron microscopy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

What’s the role of inhibition?</li>\n<li>Flow of information through the neocortex\n<ul>\n<li>Sensory information reaches the cortex from thalamus by the thalamocortical axons that terminate primarily in layer 4.</li>\n<li>Accordingly, layer 4 cells also show the shortest latency to sensory stimuli.</li>\n<li>Data supports the hypothesis that at each level of cortical processing, neurons are sampling from a larger input space, receiving convergent information from the previous level, and forming larger and more complex integrated and combinatorial receptive fields.</li>\n<li>There’s also substantial horizontal interconnectivity which integrates information from neighboring and distant regions.</li>\n<li>Horizontal connections may be particularly relevant for cortical map reorganization since it appears that areas that develop novel receptive fields after peripheral input manipulations may rely, in large part, on connections from neighboring cortical sectors.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Cortical plasticity\n<ul>\n<li>The cortex can allocate cortical area in a use-dependent manner.</li>\n<li>Review of Hebb’s rule.</li>\n<li>The detection of temporally correlated inputs provides a mechanism for forming topographic maps and for cortical cell assemblies to represent learned stimuli.</li>\n<li>A fundamental idea in neuroscience is that a change in the synaptic efficacy between two neurons is a substrate for learning and memory.</li>\n<li>One of the first examples of associative/Hebbian plasticity was described in hippocampal CA1 neurons.</li>\n<li>Review of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD).</li>\n<li>No notes on the protocols used to induce LTP.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Primary cortical sensory areas are organized topographically.</li>\n<li>E.g. S1, A1, and V1.</li>\n<li>Review of cortical plasticity following input destruction.</li>\n<li>E.g. Destroying the nerves supplying finger digit information.</li>\n<li>Hebbian plasticity is thought to play an important role in both cortical development and cortical reorganization in adult animals.</li>\n<li>Since Hebbian plasticity is based on the temporal correlations of inputs and since inputs from neighboring skin regions are generally more correlated than nonadjacent areas, neighboring cortical areas should represent neighboring surface areas, thus establishing a topographic map.</li>\n<li>A prediction from this hypothesis is that if the correlation between neighboring skin surfaces changes, then these changes should be reflected in cortical maps.</li>\n<li>Evidence supports this prediction and is consistent with the hypothesis that Hebbian synapses underlie cortical map formation and alteration.</li>\n<li>Review of the barrel cortex in rodents.</li>\n<li>In addition to the expansion of spared inputs, a retraction of the lesioned inputs occurred in parallel.</li>\n<li>Recordings made weeks after lesions to both retinas revealed that the cortical area previously responsive to the lesioned area acquired new receptive fields corresponding to areas surrounding retina around the lesion.</li>\n<li>However, this only occurs when both retinas are lesioned and not only one retina due to many V1 neurons having binocular receptive fields.</li>\n<li>E.g. Lesions to only one retina showed that the cortical topography was relatively unchanged.</li>\n<li>Further studies suggest that neurons can acquire novel inputs not only from neighboring retinal areas but also from distant nonadjacent areas.</li>\n<li>The examples of cortical map reorganization discussed so far were due to depriving the cortex of its normal inputs by lesioning, but we can also show changes in cortical map organization by reverse deprivation aka training.</li>\n<li>Skill-learning studies show that an increase in the activity of a limited subset of inputs can result in representational expansion.</li>\n<li>This shows that the cortex can dynamically allocate area in a use-dependent manner to different engaged inputs throughout life.</li>\n<li>E.g. An almost twofold expansion of the cortical representation of nipple-bearing skin in lactating female rats compared to nonlactating female rats.</li>\n<li>E.g. An almost twofold expansion in the size of representation of finger tips in monkeys that had to perform a difficult small-object retrieval task.</li>\n<li>E.g. Increased right hand representations in Braille readers compare to their left hand and non-Braille readers.</li>\n<li>Criteria to judge whether synaptic plasticity is necessary and sufficient for cortical map reorganization\n<ul>\n<li>Synaptic plasticity in the appropriate pathways should be seen with cortical representational reorganization.\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. The appropriate thalamocortical and corticocortical pathways should differ compared to control animals.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The manipulations that block synaptic plasticity should also block cortical reorganization.\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. Pharmacological and genetic synaptic blockers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Induction of synaptic plasticity in vivo should be sufficient to generate cortical reorganization measured by changes in cortical map topography.</li>\n<li>Synaptic plasticity and the learning rules that govern this plasticity should be sufficient to fully explain the experimental data.\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. Computers models/simulations that incorporate known experimental forms of plasticity should be sufficient to generate models that account for cortical representational reorganization.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Virtually every level of the nervous system seems to exhibit plasticity under certain circumstances.</li>\n<li>But the primary site of plasticity appears to be the cortex; cortical and not subcortical.</li>\n<li>E.g. After training monkeys on a tactile task where adjacent fingers received simultaneous stimulation, many somatosensory cortical units developed combined-digit receptive fields but thalamic recordings didn’t reveal any combined-digit receptive fields. Thus, the convergence of information from different fingers seems to happen in the cortex.</li>\n<li>Related findings have also been reported in the visual system.</li>\n<li>Topographic changes could come from the strengthening or sprouting of thalamocortical axons and/or intracortical horizontal projections.</li>\n<li>It appears that novel receptive fields initially result from horizontal information flow mediated through corticocortical connections.</li>\n<li>E.g. After focal lesions to both retinae, collateral axons from cortical neurons surrounding the lesioned visual field branched predominately into the deprived area as opposed to the normal area. In contrast, labeling of thalamocortical axons showed that they didn’t extend into all of the reactivated cortex.</li>\n<li>E.g. Pairing whiskers in rodents led to early changes due to corticocortical plasticity and that later changes were likely due to the potentiation of existing thalamocortical connections or the formation of new ones.</li>\n<li>While these results suggest that the cortex is the primary site of cortical reorganization, it’s difficult to rule out contributions of plasticity occurring elsewhere.</li>\n<li>One possibility is that initial reorganization occurs in the cortex and that later reorganization occurs in subcortical areas in a retrograde fashion.</li>\n<li>If associative LTP is the primary mechanism underlying cortical reorganization, and if associative LTP depends on NMDA receptors, then blocking NMDA receptors should prevent cortical map reorganization.</li>\n<li>Studies find that NMDA receptor antagonists do interfere with cortical map development and plasticity in squirrel monkeys and cats.</li>\n<li>A problem with interpreting these experiments, however, is distinguishing whether reorganization was blocked due to NMDA being involved in synaptic plasticity, or reorganization was blocked because of experimental manipulations that inactivated the cortex.</li>\n<li>Review of computational models of the development and reorganization of cortical maps.</li>\n<li>Two fundamental mechanisms invoked by computational models\n<ul>\n<li>Hebbian learning where cooperative synapses are strengthened.</li>\n<li>Competitive mechanism of balancing weakened and strengthened synapses.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>While Hebbian plasticity is often emphasized as the mechanism underlying cortical map formation and reorganization, cortical reorganization to deafferentation can essentially be simulated based only on passive decay and postsynaptic normalization.</li>\n<li>E.g. A nerve transection deprives the cortex of all inputs from digits D1, D2, and D3. Due to passive decay, synapses from the D1, D2, and D3 pathways are weakened. As a result of the weakening, synapses from D4 are strengthened due to postsynaptic normalization.</li>\n<li>Postsynaptic normalization is a critical component of many models but there’s been little direct experimental evidence for such as mechanism.</li>\n<li>One issue is that observations of postsynaptic normalization may require a time course longer than the life span of slice experiments.</li>\n<li>Evidence supports the notion that the level of postsynaptic depolarization determines whether LTD or LTP is induced.</li>\n<li>E.g. Low frequency stimulation (1 Hz) results in LTD, while high-frequency stimulation (100 Hz) results in LTP.</li>\n<li>We do not yet have a sufficient understanding of synaptic and cellular plasticity to fully account for the experimental data on cortical representational reorganization.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"on-the-nature-and-use-of-models-in-network-neuroscience\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#on-the-nature-and-use-of-models-in-network-neuroscience\" aria-label=\"on the nature and use of models in network neuroscience permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41583-018-0038-8\">On the nature and use of models in network neuroscience</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>This paper examines the field of network neuroscience by focusing on organizing principles that can reduce confusion and facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration.</li>\n<li>First, we describe the fundamental goals in constructing network models.</li>\n<li>Second, we review the most common network models along three dimensions: data-theory, structural-functional, and elementary-coarse.</li>\n<li>Third, we draw on biology, philosophy, and other disciplines to establish validation principles for these models.</li>\n<li>Review of the neuron doctrine;

A biophysical model of synaptic transmission in the dentate gyrus isn’t likely to provide direct insight into the functional phenomenology of the default-mode network.</li>\n<li>Assessing the validity and effectiveness of a particular network model can be challenging because of the diversity of goals and uses.</li>\n<li>We propose a classification system for validating network models on different goals and domains.</li>\n<li>Descriptive validity\n<ul>\n<li>Does the model resemble the base system?</li>\n<li>This validity is often used in animal models by comparing different species to each other and to humans.</li>\n<li>How well does the structure of the model match the anatomical and/or functional data that it represents?</li>\n<li>E.g. Network models where edges are assigned continuous weights representing anatomical connections have more descriptive validity than edges assigned binary weights.</li>\n<li>One difficulty is identifying the appropriate level of complexity that should be modelled.</li>\n<li>Another difficulty is that individual variability creates uncertainty on whether network features are signal or noise.</li>\n<li>In general, little is known about the principles that govern individual differences in neural connectivity patterns in organisms with central nervous systems.</li>\n<li>However, network structure and function do differ across people and these differences are associated with cognitive functions and symptom severity for certain diseases.</li>\n<li>Network dynamics also show individual differences.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Explanatory validity\n<ul>\n<li>This category focuses on developing statistical tests to support conclusions drawn from the use of the model.</li>\n<li>E.g. A network model of the brain is considered to have explanatory validity if its architecture can be justified in terms of brain data and if it can then be used to test for causal relationships on the basis of that architecture.</li>\n<li>Explanatory validity requires an assessment of both a model’s architecture and its ability to test for causal relationships.</li>\n<li>These two criterion can be tested using statistical model-selection approaches.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Predictive validity\n<ul>\n<li>A statistical model is predictive if there’s a correlation between the output from perturbing the model and the output from perturbing the organism.</li>\n<li>E.g. Adding, removing, strengthening, or weakening a node or edge in the network should affect the model in a way that predicts the same outcome to the same perturbation in the organism.</li>\n<li>Building models with predictive validity comes after descriptive and explanatory validity, and are thus new to neuroscience.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>With the multitude of model and validity types, it’s important that investigators clearly specify their study’s goals because insights drawn from one type of model can be different from another type of model.</li>\n<li>One strength of network neuroscience is that it has built many descriptive models but lacks explanatory and predictive models.</li>\n<li>Models designed to explain are assessed according to goodness of fit but can be overfit to the data.</li>\n<li>Models designed to predict are assessed according to their ability to generalize.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"sleep-is-for-forgetting\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#sleep-is-for-forgetting\" aria-label=\"sleep is for forgetting permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0820-16.2017\">Sleep Is for Forgetting</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>One possible function of sleep is to erase and forget information built up throughout the day that would clutter the synaptic networks that define us.</li>\n<li>This paper discusses and illustrates the importance of forgetting for development, for memory integration and updating, and for resetting sensory-motor synapses after intense use.</li>\n<li>Sleep could serve this unique forgetting function for memory circuits within reach of the locus coeruleus (LC) and those formed and governed outside its noradrenergic net.</li>\n<li>Review of rapid eye movement (REM), transition-to-REM (TR), slow-wave sleep (SWS).</li>\n<li>Forgetting to avoid saturation\n<ul>\n<li>Sleep preserves memory from gradual degradation over time.</li>\n<li>However, the type of forgetting discussed here isn’t passive degradation but rather the active and targeted erasure of synapses.</li>\n<li>It’s been hypothesized that REM sleep was for forgetting useless information learned throughout the day that, if not eliminated, would saturate the memory synaptic network with junk.</li>\n<li>The type of forgetting discussed here also isn’t the global synaptic weight downscaling of the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis (SHY).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Arguments of this paper\n<ul>\n<li>It’s the targeted erasure of synapses that’s unique to sleep.</li>\n<li>This targeted forgetting is necessary for efficient learning.</li>\n<li>Deficits in this process may underlie various kinds of intellectual disabilities and mental health problems.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Hippocampal activity for forgetting during REM sleep\n<ul>\n<li>One way to test if sleep is for forgetting or for remembering is to test the activity of hippocampal neurons during sleep.</li>\n<li>The hippocampus forms initial associative memories and temporarily stores them until they’re consolidated to the neocortex.</li>\n<li>It’s logical then that the hippocampal network of weighted synapses be recycled for future learning.</li>\n<li>Review of place cells and long-term potentiation (LTP).</li>\n<li>Place cells are most active at the peaks of theta frequency (5-10 Hz) local field potential patterns during active waking.</li>\n<li>Activity during the positive phase of the theta rhythm (peak) induced LTP, while stimulation in the opposite phase, the theta trough, induced a decrease in synaptic efficacy.</li>\n<li>We found that once a place becomes familiar to the animal, the place cells reversed their primary firing phase with respect to local theta oscillations during REM sleep.</li>\n<li>The time course that place cells switched from the novel peak firing pattern in REM sleep to the familiar trough firing pattern matched the time course of memory consolidation from the hippocampus to neocortex.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Forgetting is necessary to incorporate novel information into established schema\n<ul>\n<li>Long-term depression (LTD), the reverse of LTP, is also induced by learning.</li>\n<li>The hypothesis that REM sleep is unique for forgetting predicts that any learning that requires depotentiation would be compromised by its disturbance.</li>\n<li>One type of learning that requires forgetting is reversal learning.</li>\n<li>E.g. Learning that Santa isn’t real.</li>\n<li>If LTD didn’t happen to at least some of the synapses encoding the original information, then we would have redundant and conflicting information during memory recall, making us confused as to what’s true and what’s false.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Targeted forgetting is unique to sleep\n<ul>\n<li>The theta phase specificity of experience-dependent reactivation in the hippocampus revealed an elegant sleep-dependent memory function.</li>\n<li>Why would such an important function as rewiring a memory schema not occur during waking?</li>\n<li>One line of research suggests that the LTD step in the rewiring process is only reliably induced in the absence of norepinephrine (NE).</li>\n<li>NE blocks depotentiation and enhances LTP.</li>\n<li>E.g. Stimulating the source of NE to the forebrain, the LC, or direct application of NE through intracerebroventricular infusion enhances and prolongs LTP.</li>\n<li>Sustained LC silence normally only occurs during sleep.</li>\n<li>E.g. NE neurons in the LC are only suppressed during REM sleep and during the transition-to-REM (TR; stage 2 in human sleep).</li>\n<li>REM sleep and TR are perhaps the only times when synaptic circuits within LC’s reach could be refreshed and reset from the day’s relentless accumulation of connectivity.</li>\n<li>Perhaps the TR state is so short (30-60s in humans) precisely because it’s such a powerful time for bidirectional plasticity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>No notes on NE bursts to terminate sleep spindles.</li>\n<li>The TR state, when the hippocampus and cortex uniquely synchronize during sleep spindles to transfer memories from the hippocampus to neocortex, is a vulnerable period when memories can be modified.</li>\n<li>Synapse elimination is essential in every developing circuit with experience-dependent refinement.</li>\n<li>E.g. Muscle innervation, imprinting, visual cortex development.</li>\n<li>Interestingly, REM sleep is especially abundant during early development as at birth, half or more of our sleep time is occupied by REM sleep compared to the less than 20% of sleep for adults.</li>\n<li>In juvenile birds learning bird songs, studies found that sleep reduced song complexity built up during the day and the noise from the day before was gone.</li>\n<li>In imprinting, learning the parent’s features was followed by immediate and impressive increases in REM sleep.</li>\n<li>Electrophysiological data is also consistent with the idea that without proper REM and TR sleep, neurons remain overconnected in the imprinting circuitry.</li>\n<li>If pruning fails, the synapses encoding alternative features remain and the animal remains open to imprinting on features of other individuals.</li>\n<li>Thus, imprinting shows how important targeted forgetting is for survival.</li>\n<li>Both REM and TR sleep rise during intensive learning periods.</li>\n<li>Sleep also serves a critical role in resetting the synaptic weights of primary sensory areas undergoing continuous amplification during waking.</li>\n<li>Many studies show that staying awake during the time from training to testing interferes with memory performance.</li>\n<li>Perhaps the memory degradation induced by staying awake for a long time is actually due to a buildup of interference rather than slow forgetting due to synaptic weakening.</li>\n<li>E.g. Slowly saturating circuits would result in a loss of specificity and clarity of information traces.</li>\n<li>Sleep is a protected time away from waking sensory interference to encode memories and to raise important memories above noise.</li>\n<li>E.g. In a study of experienced bicycle riders trained to ride a bicycle with reversed handles, subjects that slept after training were more likely to forget the training, erasing the sensorimotor learning gains compared to those who didn’t sleep.</li>\n<li>The authors of this study interpret their findings to mean that REM and TR sleep spindles might protect everyday needed skills like riding a bicycle by forgetting the interfering and irrelevant material.</li>\n<li>When memory reactivation occurs during sleep spindles without the ability to depotentiate synapses, circuits requiring reconsolidation become entangled.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 976px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/CR4-DL/static/2781965e9649e39490b72dc09cfd57b6/798d4/figure2-8.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 84.39999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Figure 2\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/CR4-DL/static/2781965e9649e39490b72dc09cfd57b6/798d4/figure2-8.png\"\n        srcset=\"/CR4-DL/static/2781965e9649e39490b72dc09cfd57b6/63868/figure2-8.png 250w,\n/CR4-DL/static/2781965e9649e39490b72dc09cfd57b6/0b533/figure2-8.png 500w,\n/CR4-DL/static/2781965e9649e39490b72dc09cfd57b6/798d4/figure2-8.png 976w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 976px) 100vw, 976px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>E.g.

When blood flow suddenly ceases, approximately 15s afterwards consciousness is lost.</li>\n<li>From this evidence, it was almost universally believed that blood-flow increases associated with cellular-activity increases must be related to the need for more oxygen.</li>\n<li>However, it came as a surprise that activity-induced increases in blood flow aren’t accompanied by proportionate increases in oxygen consumption.</li>\n<li>Although oxygen consumption does increase, this increase is much less than the increase in blood flow and glucose consumption.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Blood flow and oxidative phosphorylation\n<ul>\n<li>Two interesting findings\n<ul>\n<li>Decreasing the oxygen availability in circulating blood by having normal subjects breathe air with reduced oxygen fails to cause a compensatory blood-flow response when brain cellular activity is stimulated.</li>\n<li>Sustained visual stimulation (25 mins) is associated with an initial increase in blood flow in excess of oxygen consumption but over time, oxygen consumption increases as blood flow falls.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Both of these findings dissociate the link between blood flow and demand for oxygen.</li>\n<li>If the brain were to rely on a precise increase in oxygen delivery every time neuronal activity suddenly increased, a change in blood flow wouldn’t be the answer because it’s too slow.</li>\n<li>E.g. After an event, blood flow doesn’t reach its maximum for 4-6 seconds.</li>\n<li>Instead, the brain can extract more oxygen from circulating blood.</li>\n<li>E.g. On average, about 40% of available oxygen is removed from blood passing through the brain.</li>\n<li>However, evidence for this hypothesis is controversial.</li>\n<li>The vast majority of the energy consumed by the brain is produced by the metabolism of glucose to carbon dioxide and water.</li>\n<li>Review of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation.</li>\n</ul>\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 527px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/CR4-DL/static/0d43d24a406bffebb4d99a9b4d97a586/44385/figure3-10.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 151.99999999999997%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAeCAIAAACjcKk8AAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAADlUlEQVR42pVUC3PaOBD2//9JN5NpeimEXNKGtASK8UOyJEvyC4NtHn6ln0ybthy9ye2AvSPv49tvd2W9/CJ93+NJst3V3fRq/HA9mV7dPj6LzXB8QazfnIdncWhdmX1e0dvp3JNpWtUvL29w/jXEZpOTgDu6JMmOZ/u3OncDynWeh1JtD21SHNOyfqvzsXuZLPn1w/PdzLmd03jwvFj2Wc1933VpXtzMvPHT1/F08e6TrYv/dO4HOSmEkPFoFHARpXm2zl9b8CbYpzB918swfHaFrSpwttLlvm4HOgyE0884N02zWi4n4wljXAj+4eZmdHPDGUvjKMvWdfdyqNvq2HSX8lvIVFXVbrev63q/35dFwXUaV43MK6oz1LvdNyfTzb6NyybdtUnVgEXEs/49YUu9fX/3NLr/PHmc/z35NJ4HjusR338/tT98nI3un/66Hn2hcb7vfhL2o9puQcSjI+ZEzTzhyJylBaAdDgeVV67euCrHj613ddufEwbwzspWSokwRM3/j21DaWfsy7J49uVCljO+Qa/dqFyExTwsPF3OxRb8t681n8KnaTKbze7v7qjvRwo7keGwaTsgBD+HpgPrx9YoddudZ+7adr0taVxgpnlWemqd7buoqGF9Gbbp+LBJp9LY5vhkk3ejf5ZUThfu5OPT9cPibEL7H5tn/b5Mfb6rPb11ZLYKM7C6EsmCp9jwYerOxfKyg9jWaD22r/sjr39ge071/TKwA8VVnCRplmVJCqayJEniOIYax0bBOfQkTqJIn75uNhsrjjT1PUaJ5zoBDTjn9tKmhDqQ1YoLHlC2chycu+bEsW3b9ykLWFmWFnZAqShNEh1BYgHhPBShUhpDss7WWBcWBEh7AbaPuSUBQmIHPc+jhCitGYM9UDAlpRAhEIVCAjOAbLfFT2cZSpgiGxSlFXJqrY0ujWBI4yjCVxABTMSnGB4lo2IIYQUBM2mlBH4pdaTBTqyVgj8hFGFD8V0Y6maM+J7r+shxrGsLZkAI6oTJfyo1gz9MPdeLdIQlQWhlRIMtXBloSr5e4xKwTJLhk+t6WirHcQEbeQb8wAgqDCgaMEANw5BSWpRV27RmSAyxUnHGES+OowGgcUM2MBSbDuCVwE0biUxYESIf7i8LL2pqYxgCVOM6nj+URHyCMPBU2jQS9SJcANBcHI7H72wTc8MQ1NN1XVM3uAyapkXUtm3NvzPbbfTh5CSv18M3IBWbeRLXOp4AAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Figure 3\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/CR4-DL/static/0d43d24a406bffebb4d99a9b4d97a586/44385/figure3-10.png\"\n        srcset=\"/CR4-DL/static/0d43d24a406bffebb4d99a9b4d97a586/63868/figure3-10.png 250w,\n/CR4-DL/static/0d43d24a406bffebb4d99a9b4d97a586/0b533/figure3-10.png 500w,\n/CR4-DL/static/0d43d24a406bffebb4d99a9b4d97a586/44385/figure3-10.png 527w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span>\n<ul>\n<li>Oxidative phosphorylation is more efficient than glycolysis because it produces more ATP, but glycolysis can be used during rapid increases in neuronal activity.</li>\n<li>Glycolysis is faster and can operate without oxygen.</li>\n<li>No notes on the role of astrocytes in brain metabolism.</li>\n<li>Astrocytes are the only store of glycogen in the brain.</li>\n<li>Our current information is inconclusive on the possibilities that a sustained increase in neuronal activity might cause a new baseline level of oxidative phosphorylation.</li>\n<li>Above, we focused entirely on evoked increases in brain activity, however, this likely represents only a small fraction of the true functional activity of the brain.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Activity decreases (deactivations)\n<ul>\n<li>Generally, brain imaging work has emphasized task-induced increases in regional brain activity associated with executing a wide variety of tasks.</li>\n<li>However, we’ve become aware of task-induced decreases in regional brain activity; what we call the default mode network of the brain.</li>\n<li>One challenge with interpreting activity decreases is defining a baseline level of activity.</li>\n<li>E.g.

If we replayed the experience of pain, is this unethical because the subject is conscious? Or is it ok because the subject is unconscious?</li>\n<li>Neural prosthetics may provide clues as to whether activating the brain by replay results in loss of consciousness.</li>\n<li>E.g. Blind patients can see with implants of an electrode array in their visual cortex. Deaf patients can hear with cochlear implants.</li>\n<li>One of the central assumptions in neuroscience is that consciousness is produced by the events occurring in neurons.</li>\n<li>The thought experiment proposed here challenges that assumption and applies not only to brains but also to computer hardware and other biological organs.</li>\n<li>Do action potentials cause consciousness?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"memory-engrams-recalling-the-past-and-imagining-the-future\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#memory-engrams-recalling-the-past-and-imagining-the-future\" aria-label=\"memory engrams recalling the past and imagining the future permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaw4325\">Memory engrams: Recalling the past and imagining the future</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The goal of this paper is to review recent progress in studying engrams.</li>\n<li>Engram: the basic unit of memory; the neural substrate for storing and recalling memories.</li>\n<li>Richard Semon proposed that an experience activates a population of neurons that undergo persistent chemical and/or physical changes to become an engram.</li>\n<li>Subsequent reactivation of the engram by cues induce memory retrieval.</li>\n<li>The resurgence of research into engrams started with two complementary studies.\n<ul>\n<li>One study showed that ablating a subset of lateral amygdala neurons disrupted subsequent memory retrieval.</li>\n<li>Another study showed that artificially reactivating a subset of hippocampal dentate gyrus neurons that were active during a fearful experience induced memory retrieval in the absence of an external retrieval cue.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Recent research into engrams has found that neurons compete for allocation to an engram and this excitability-based competition also guides the organization of multiple engrams in the brain.</li>\n<li>We also found increased synaptic strength and spine density in neurons that are part of an engram, as well as preferential connectivity to other downstream engram cells.</li>\n<li>Thus, both increased intrinsic excitability and synaptic plasticity work together to form and retrieve engrams.</li>\n<li>It’s now possible to artificially manipulate memory encoding and retrieval processes to generate false memories.</li>\n<li>Questions remaining about engrams\n<ul>\n<li>How does engram architecture affect memory quality, strength, and precision?</li>\n<li>How do multiple engrams interact?</li>\n<li>How do engrams change over time?</li>\n<li>What’s the role of engram silencing?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Memory: the ability to use the past in service of the present or future.</li>\n<li>That memory persists after an experience suggests that an internal representation of the experience is stored in the brain and can be later reconstructed and used.</li>\n<li>An engram is roughly equivalent to a memory trace.</li>\n<li>Review of Karl Lashley’s experiments that failed to find the engram in rats and Donald O.

Illusions, afterimages, imagery, and hallucinations.</li>\n<li>Anatomical evidence also shows that there’s no final integrator station in the brain that receives input from all visual areas, instead, each node has multiple outputs and no node only has inputs.</li>\n<li>This suggests that each node of the visual system creates its own microconsciousness since there’s no “consciousness node” where all visual activity is gathered.</li>\n<li>We propose that, if any binding occurs to give us our integrated image of the visual world, it must be a binding between microconsciousness generated at different nodes.</li>\n<li>We cover two sets of experiments that lead to unexpected results on the nature of consciousness and the brain.</li>\n<li>The first unexpected result was from studying the visual capabilities of a patient deprived of vision by a lesion in V1 sustained during childhood.</li>\n<li>Blindsight: when a patient with visual cortex damage can discriminate the direction of motion of stimuli in their visual field with no conscious awareness of seeing.</li>\n<li>We want to learn what areas of the brain become activated during blindsight that enable the patient to discriminate motion.</li>\n<li>Surprisingly, the patient could not only correctly discriminate the direction of motion of fast moving stimuli, but was also conscious of having seen them.</li>\n<li>This showed that activity in areas disconnected from V1 can have a conscious correlate.</li>\n<li>Indeed, we guess that activity at any given stage of a processing system can have a conscious correlate.</li>\n<li>The second unexpected result came from assuming that the unity and wholeness of our vision comes from processing different visual attributes at the same time, or at least that an integrator area or process brings these results together to provide an integrated image.</li>\n<li>But this assumption has not been tested.</li>\n<li>When tested, we were surprised to find that when two simultaneous visual features occur, such as color and motion, they’re not perceived at the same time.</li>\n<li>E.g. Color is perceived before motion.</li>\n<li>This argues that the systems processing color and motion, and perhaps other visual features, are independent and autonomous of each other.</li>\n<li>Together, both results are mutually supportive and also receive support from other lines of evidence.</li>\n<li>This paper represents a synthesis of views on different aspects of conscious vision and incorporates three theories: asynchrony of consciousness, multistage integration, and relative perceptual sites, leading us to a more general theory of visual consciousness.</li>\n<li>We start with the fact that the visual brain consists of many different visual areas, each having a distinct pattern of connections and each performing its task simultaneously and in parallel with others.</li>\n<li>E.g. The connections between the blobs in V1 and the thin stripes in V2 and V4 are involved in color. The connections between layer 4B of V1 and the thick stripes in V2 and V5 are involved in motion.</li>\n<li>This is the principle of multiplicity of visual areas and has been established beyond doubt.</li>\n<li>We define a processing system as one that includes the specialized cells of V1 and V2, and the specialized areas that they project to.</li>\n<li>Different processing systems are specialized to perform different tasks.</li>\n<li>Evidence for this comes from studies of anatomical connections, physiological properties, and clinical cases.</li>\n<li>The contrary view, that there are no specializations within V1 or V2, is a view we don’t agree with.</li>\n<li>Proposition 1: the visual brain consists of parallel, distributed, and functionally specialized processing systems.</li>\n<li>Each processing system consists of several stages, which we call nodes. By node or stage we refer to a whole area such as V4 or V5, or to a functional subdivision of an area such as the blobs and interblobs of V1 or the thin, thick, and interstripes of V2.</li>\n<li>The forward connections within this processing system are of the “like-with-like” variety.</li>\n<li>E.g. The directionally selective cells of layer 4B connect with area V5, which is also rich in directionally selective cells.</li>\n<li>The result of connecting these nodes is to enlarge receptive fields and to confer different, and often more complex, properties on cells in a given node.</li>\n<li>Not all of these nodes need to be simultaneously or sequentially active for visual perception to occur.</li>\n<li>Proposition 2: forward connections within a processing system are of the like-with-like variety and lead to cells of increasing receptive field size and complexity in hierarchical fashion.</li>\n<li>Nodes from different processing systems can communicate to each other through lateral connections or “like-with-unlike” connections.</li>\n<li>E.g. Direct connections between the specialized areas such as between V4 and V5.</li>\n<li>In contrast to the forward connections from V1 and V2 to V4 and V5, the return/reciprocal connections from these specialized areas to V1 and V2 are diffuse.</li>\n<li>E.g. The return input from V5 to V2 is more diffuse and isn’t restricted to the territory of the thick stripes but includes the thin stripes and interstripes as well.</li>\n<li>The motion and color systems thus have the anatomical ability to communicate with each other through these return projections and through direct lateral connections.</li>\n<li>What’s surprising, given the abundance of like-with-unlike anatomical connections, is how stable the properties of cells in the visual nodes are.</li>\n<li>E.g. Most orientation and direction selective cells are indifferent to the color of the stimulus and vice versa, even after prolonged stimulation with an attribute that they’re not selective for.</li>\n<li>Also surprising is that in spite of these lateral connections, the majority of cells within a given processing system continue to be selective for a given attribute of the visual scene rather than with all attributes.</li>\n<li>Although it remains possible that they help to derive one attribute from another.</li>\n<li>E.g. Deriving motion from form.</li>\n<li>A central claim of the temporal binding hypothesis is that the binding of different attributes is mediated by a special temporal relationship between specialized areas.</li>\n<li>E.g. Synchronous firing.</li>\n<li>While the temporal binding hypothesis could be true, we note that in spite of the many anatomical opportunities mentioned above, there’s no compelling evidence for it between visual areas that process different visual attributes.</li>\n<li>There is no known common characteristic feature that emerges from lateral connections.</li>\n<li>Proposition 3: the lateral interconnections that anatomically link the different processing systems can be of the like-with-like, the like-with-unlike, or the diffuse variety and aren’t exclusively hierarchical; they don’t appear to bring about cells that integrate different submodalities.</li>\n<li>No node is a terminal stage in a processing system since there’s no known node that’s input only. Every node both receives inputs and sends outputs.</li>\n<li>Proposition 4: there’s no terminal station in the cortex for a given processing system and no common terminal area to which the different processing systems connect.</li>\n<li>Our theory of multiconsciousness supposes that activity at each node can become perceptually explicit and therefore have a conscious correlate, leading to many microconsciousnesses.</li>\n<li>The information at a node, represented as neuronal activity, becomes explicit not only by virtue of the input to it, but also because of its anatomical  machinery and specialized physiological capacities, which can be thought of as a memory.</li>\n<li>Since nodes within a single processing system are hierarchically connected, the input to one node may contain implicit information that requires further processing at the same or at further sites to become perceptually explicit.</li>\n<li>The enlargement of receptive fields are examples of physiological integration which have both perceptual and conscious consequences.</li>\n<li>E.g. From lateral geniculate nucleus to V1, from V1 to V2, and from V1 to V5.</li>\n<li>This enlargement grants cells at a node unique information that isn’t explicitly present at nodes above or below it; it generates new “experiential” cells.</li>\n<li>This suggests that a conscious percept might be based on the activity of only a few cells in a node.</li>\n<li>E.g. In the color system, the enlargement of receptive fields from V1 to V4 is accompanied by a qualitative jump as responses in V1 correlate with stimulus wavelength, whereas responses in V4 correlate with perceived color, regardless of precise wavelength composition.</li>\n<li>Thus, each stage can make a direct, but varied, contribution to conscious perception.</li>\n<li>Two types of binding/integration\n<ul>\n<li>Generative binding: generates cells with new receptive field properties and is followed by receptive field enlargement.\n<ul>\n<li>These cells combine the activity of two or more cells in a reliable and reproducible way.</li>\n<li>E.g. Simple cells in V1 from center-surround retinal ganglion cells and face selective cells.</li>\n<li>This binding results in new classes of experiential cells whose activity has a conscious correlate.</li>\n<li>Since this conscious correlate is restricted to the visual domain, we call this a microconsciousness.</li>\n<li>This binding is preconscious because it’s the process of binding itself that generates a new class of cell whose activity can have a conscious correlate.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Parallel binding: the coupling of neuronal activity within an area or across different areas.\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. Synchronous or oscillatory firing.</li>\n<li>This binding is postconscious since it’s the microconsciousness generated at a given node of one processing system that’s bound to the microconsciousness generated at another node.</li>\n<li>We hypothesize that mere communication between areas won’t result in a microconscious correlate and that only neuronal activity at nodes does so.</li>\n<li>For this binding to affect consciousness, it must change the activity at nodes that are then reflected as changes in microconsciousness.</li>\n<li>Unlike its generative counterpart, postconscious integration doesn’t entail receptive field enlargement or change since it doesn’t bring the responses of two cells together into a third cell.</li>\n<li>Instead, this binding may use a form of communication between neurons that’s different and independent of the communication used for feature specificity of neurons.</li>\n<li>Here, we depart from the more common belief that it’s the binding itself that results in conscious experience.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>This distinction between generative and parallel binding hasn’t been made before, but parallel binding has been explored as a way to integrate different visual attributes such as color and motion.</li>\n<li>Proposition 5: generative or preconscious integration is hierarchical and is limited to a given processing system; it leads to a new class of receptive field properties and to Proposition 6.</li>\n<li>Proposition 6: parallel or postconscious integration isn’t hierarchical and can occur between different nodes of different processing systems.</li>\n<li>Next we discuss the asynchrony of consciousness.</li>\n<li>Are two visual events that occur simultaneously also perceived simultaneously?</li>\n<li>Intuitively, we would suspect yes because our daily experience suggests so.</li>\n<li>However, there’s a large body of evidence showing that different sensory modalities are perceived with different delays from the time of stimulus onset. This is also true for attributes within a modality.</li>\n<li>E.g. When subjects are asked to pair two rapidly changing states of two attributes, say a bar being red or green and either vertical or horizontal, we find that subjects mistakenly bind attributes between the two states.</li>\n<li>E.g. Color is perceived before orientation, which is perceived before motion, with about 30 ms and 40 ms lag times respectively.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1000px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/CR4-DL/static/110d6a068e7717f7143bbe60fe23fba9/ab40b/figure1-16.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 77.6%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Figure 1\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/CR4-DL/static/110d6a068e7717f7143bbe60fe23fba9/00d43/figure1-16.png\"\n        srcset=\"/CR4-DL/static/110d6a068e7717f7143bbe60fe23fba9/63868/figure1-16.png 250w,\n/CR4-DL/static/110d6a068e7717f7143bbe60fe23fba9/0b533/figure1-16.png 500w,\n/CR4-DL/static/110d6a068e7717f7143bbe60fe23fba9/00d43/figure1-16.png 1000w,\n/CR4-DL/static/110d6a068e7717f7143bbe60fe23fba9/aa440/figure1-16.png 1500w,\n/CR4-DL/static/110d6a068e7717f7143bbe60fe23fba9/ab40b/figure1-16.png 1736w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>These studies confirm that the neural processing of different visual attributes is segregated in the cortex.</li>\n<li>The consequence of this perceptual asynchrony is that over short time periods, subjects mistakenly bind attributes.</li>\n<li>E.g. Attributing a color at time t to a direction of motion at time t - 1.</li>\n<li>Thus, the brain doesn’t necessarily bind together what happens in real time but instead binds results from different processing systems, which requires different amounts of time to complete.</li>\n<li>This also implies that there’s no central perceptual integrator area that accounts for the different delays of different systems with regard to real time.</li>\n<li>Proposition 7: another characteristic of the visual brain is a temporal asynchrony in vision, resulting in visual perception being modular.</li>\n<li>Proposition 8: when two visual events occur together, they don’t have to be integrated for each to be perceived, and thus a mutual integration of activity between different processing nodes isn’t necessary for the creation of a conscious perception.</li>\n<li>Proposition 9: activity in each processing node generates a microconsciousness for the attribute that node is specialized for.</li>\n<li>But not all simultaneous visual events are perceived asynchronously.</li>\n<li>E.g. Asking subjects to pair left-right motion in one half of a display with up-down motion in the other half. We find that subjects perceive the two events as simultaneous.</li>\n<li>E.g. Asking subjects to pair two different depths with two different orientations. Subjects perceive the two simultaneously.</li>\n<li>Theory of perceptual sites: attributes processed at the same site are perceived simultaneously, while attributes processed at different sites are perceived at different times.</li>\n<li>Proposition 10: when two simultaneous visual events are perceived at the same time, it’s because they’re processed at the same node and when they’re perceived at different times, it’s because they’re processed at different nodes.</li>\n<li>Proposition 11: microconsciousnesses are functionally specialized, and each microconsciousness reflects the activity in a functionally specialized processing node.</li>\n<li>Generally, we’re not aware of being aware. Instead, we’re aware of events and can usually only attend to one event.</li>\n<li>Are processing systems separate from perceptual systems?</li>\n<li>We argue that processing systems are also perceptual systems.</li>\n<li>The evidence for this is controversial. We do find that some nodes’ responses correlate with perception while others don’t, suggesting nodes that don’t correlate with perception are processing nodes.</li>\n<li>However, it would also be inefficient to encode everything twice, once for processing and once again for perception. Also, maybe all nodes correlate with some feature of perception, but that we don’t know which feature.</li>\n<li>We consider well-known syndromes caused by specific lesions of the prestriate cortex and find that they share a common property: the ability to see and experience details of a given attribute without being able to combine the details into a whole.</li>\n<li>E.g. Object agnosia, achromatopsia, agnosia, prosopagnosia, and akinetopsia.</li>\n<li>In object agnosia, patients are able to see and understand simple components of a figure but the ability to integrate those simple forms into more complex forms is compromised.</li>\n<li>A capacity to see the details but not the whole.</li>\n<li>Interestingly, one patient with agnosia failed to see illusory contours such as the Kanizsa triangles.</li>\n<li>E.g. When shown the Kanizsa triangles, the patient described them as “a three cornered thing … I see three edges and three circles.”</li>\n<li>This patient wasn’t able to perceptually fill in the gaps in the Kanizsa triangle but could perceive the illusion’s elements.</li>\n<li>The remarkable feature of prosopagnosia is that subjects commonly know that they’re looking at a face but can’t recognize it.</li>\n<li>E.g. One patient related how “I can see the eyes, nose, and mouth quite clearly, but they just don’t add up.”</li>\n<li>The point emphasized here is the residual ability to see but not to combine everything into a whole.</li>\n<li>This suggests that the node responsible for faces, the fusiform gyrus, is damaged but that the preceding nodes are intact, hence why patients can identify components of faces but not faces.</li>\n<li>Achromatopsia provides further evidence for the argument that processing and perceptual systems are the same.</li>\n<li>In humans, the damage that causes achromatopsia involves area V4.</li>\n<li>Remarkably, achromatopsic patients can consciously discriminate between lights of different wavelengths but can’t describe their color.</li>\n<li>We believe this reflects the physiological capacities of the wavelength selective cells in V1 and V2 that respond to light wavelengths but aren’t concerned with color.</li>\n<li>Akinetopsia: a syndrome of motion imperception following area V5 damage.</li>\n<li>One patient with akinetopsia was described as having “a large discrepancy between detection of motion, which is unimpaired, and discrimination of motion, which was severely impaired.”</li>\n<li>Discriminating motion requires comparing, and thus integrating, local motion, which is impaired in akinetopsia patients.</li>\n<li>Detecting local motion is unimpaired because the early visual areas, namely V1, V2, and V3, are not damaged.</li>\n<li>Because V1 isn’t directly connected to the frontal lobes, it’s been suggested that we’re not aware of what happens in V1, thus excluding V1 from direct involvement in conscious experience.</li>\n<li>This may be true and so far, we don’t have evidence disproving this.</li>\n<li>However, we also have evidence that the activity in V1 could be interpreted as a direct conscious correlate.</li>\n<li>Taking all of these neurological deficits together, we find compelling evidence that there’s always residual visual capacity with lesions of the prestriate cortex and that this residual capacity is best explained by the remaining neurons.</li>\n<li>Proposition 12: damage to the prestriate component of a specific processing system doesn’t lead to the total loss of the capacity to see and understand the relevant attribute. Instead, the patient is left with a residual capacity to see and experience the elements of that attribute.</li>\n<li>Now we turn to the case where instead of later visual areas being damaged, what if early visual areas, such as V1 and V2 that feed the later visual areas, are damaged?</li>\n<li>Riddoch found that soldiers with damage to V1 were conscious of motion but not much else.</li>\n<li>We studied one patient that had similar damage to their occipital lobe and showed that they could not only discriminate accurately the direction of fast-moving, high-contrast objects, but that the patient was conscious of the direction of motion.</li>\n<li>Interestingly, the patient described the movement as a “shadow”, similar to how a normal person with their eyes closed can see something moving.</li>\n<li>This condition is called blindsight and suggests that preprocessing by area V1 isn’t necessary for the conscious experience of motion.</li>\n<li>Instead, we suspect that the ability to perceive motion without V1 is almost certainly due to direct input from the pulvinar to V5 which bypasses V1.</li>\n<li>Why would this pathway have evolved? Why does it avoid V1? Perhaps it’s due to the need to detect fast moving predators, which requires a shorter and more efficient pathway.</li>\n<li>Blindsight supports the idea that activity at a node of a processing system can have a conscious correlate without necessarily involving early stages of the visual pathway.</li>\n<li>Afterimages and hallucinations further support this idea as we find brain activity bypasses and doesn’t involve V1 but is seen in higher visual areas.</li>\n<li>Proposition 13: activity at a node of a processing system which is deafferented/disconnected from antecedent/preceding nodes can have a conscious correlate, provided there’s an input to it.</li>\n<li>Proposition 14: processing sites and perceptual sties are identical.</li>\n<li>We believe that the different processing-perceptual systems are mostly autonomous of each other as one system can execute its functions without the participation of others.</li>\n<li>This is implicit in all clinical evidence as they all show a specificity of defect.</li>\n<li>Proposition 15: processing systems are autonomous of each other.</li>\n<li>Several lines of evidence suggest that integration must be a multistage process.</li>\n<li>It’s important to note that the connections between different nodes of different processing systems allow for communication and integration between them, but that each node can function autonomously and each generate their own microconsciousness.</li>\n<li>E.g. Suppose a picture of a face is composed of small dots. Some cells respond to the dots while other cells respond to faces. We can report when a pattern of dots looks like a face, suggesting that both types of information, dots and faces, are processed and perceived separately.</li>\n<li>It remains open whether our integrated visual experience is defined by binding or whether the mere activity in an area is sufficient.</li>\n<li>The propositions proposed above form a chain that leads us to our theory of visual consciousness.</li>\n<li>We suppose that visual consciousness consists of many, functionally specialized, microconsciousnesses that are spatially and temporally distributed.</li>\n<li>Activity at each node has a microconscious correlate that’s functionally specialized and asynchronous with the microconscious correlate generated by other nodes.</li>\n<li>It isn’t surprising that there’s no terminal stage in the cortex since activity at each node represents a terminal stage of its own specialized process.</li>\n<li>Integration between different nodes must influence the microconsciousness of the connected nodes, but the communication itself doesn’t create the bound percept.</li>\n<li>We believe that communication between nodes changes the nature of the microconsciousnesses such that they generate a mutually consistent and integrated image in the brain.</li>\n<li>This still leaves us with the problem of how the microconsciousnesses are bound together, if at all.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"electrical-stimulation-of-visual-cortex-relevance-for-the-development-of-visual-cortical-prosthetics\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#electrical-stimulation-of-visual-cortex-relevance-for-the-development-of-visual-cortical-prosthetics\" aria-label=\"electrical stimulation of visual cortex relevance for the development of visual cortical prosthetics permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-vision-111815-114525\">Electrical Stimulation of Visual Cortex: Relevance for the Development of Visual Cortical Prosthetics</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Electrical stimulation of the brain is a powerful tool for exploring cortical function.</li>\n<li>Stimulation of early visual cortical areas is easily detected by subjects and produces simple visual percepts called phosphenes.</li>\n<li>A device implanted in the visual cortex that generates patterns of phosphenes could substitute for natural vision in blind patients.</li>\n<li>Such a device is called a visual cortical prosthetic.</li>\n<li>This paper reviews our current understanding of direct current stimulation (DCS) of the visual cortex, and the possibilities and limitations of visual cortical prosthetics.</li>\n<li>Currently, we can predict the location and size of phosphenes produced by stimulation but replacing natural vision will require the production of spatial temporal patterns of activity that result in the perception of complex visual objects.</li>\n<li>Stimulation of later visual cortical areas alone doesn’t usually lead to a visual percept, but it can change visual perception and performance of visual behaviors.</li>\n<li>DCS of brain tissue can evoke neural activity.</li>\n<li>E.g.

V1 neurons respond strongest when an edge or contour passes through the RF.</li>\n<li>Areas beyond V1 each contain a map of the visual field but vary from area to area as does the set of stimulus features that the neurons are most responsive to.</li>\n<li>Progressing from V1 to later stages of the visual hierarchy, RFs become larger, the map of visual space becomes less organized, and cells become more selective for complex objects.</li>\n<li>Columnar organization for feature selectivity still exists in many of these later cortical areas.</li>\n<li>E.g. In V2, we find features of binocular disparity, color, and contrast. In MT, we find direction of motion and disparity.

More pure-tone receptive fields within pSTG onset sites than in surrounding pSTG non-onset sites but these receptive fields weren’t simple strong V-shaped peaks like the classical receptive fields observed in PT and HG.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Finding suggest that there are fundamentally different representations in the lateral STG compared to medial HG/PT.</li>\n<li>E.g. pSTG onset areas aren’t simply another A1-like area despite its fast latency.</li>\n<li>Complex representations of onsets, phonetic features, envelope, and relative pitch are specific to the lateral STG, while simple representations, such as absolute pitch, were mostly encoded on HG and PT.</li>\n<li>Our above results are inconsistent with the classical model of cortical speech processing but to causally evaluate the hypothesis of parallel auditory processing, we used focal ECS on the medial and lateral parts of the auditory cortex and evaluated the artificially evoked sound patterns in HG and STG.</li>\n<li>The classical model predicts that stimulation of either region should distort, modulate, or interrupt the perception of spoken words, perhaps at different levels of representation.</li>\n<li>Our hypothesis predicts that stimulation of either region should have dissociable effects.</li>\n<li>E.g. Stimulating core HG should evoke simple sound percepts while stimulating STG should evoke complex or speech sounds.</li>\n<li>Stimulation of sites on the temporal plane evoked an immediate sound hallucination but not stimulations on lateral STG.</li>\n<li>The sound percept was heard near the contralateral ear, starting at very low stimulation thresholds.</li>\n<li>During HG stimulation, participants described sounds like “running water”, “moving gravel”, “fan sound”, “tapping”, and “buzzing”.</li>\n<li>Hallucinations were reliably evoked with every trial of stimulation.</li>\n<li>When the stimulation current amplitude was increased by 1-2 mA, participants reported louder sounds at every cortical site where sound could be evoked.</li>\n<li>When the stimulation current frequency was increased from 50 Hz to 100 Hz, participants reported louder and higher-pitched sounds.</li>\n<li>To test how stimulation affects speech perception, the ECS was synchronized with single-word presentation and participants were asked to repeat what they had heard.</li>\n<li>Interestingly, participants didn’t have any difficulty in hearing words during stimulation on temporal plane sites including HG, as stimulation of sites that evoked a sound hallucination had no effect on speech intelligibility, nor did stimulation affect the perceived sound quality of the spoken words.</li>\n<li>Surprisingly, participants frequently reported hearing both the evoked sound percepts and the spoken words independently and without distortion of either.</li>\n<li>E.g.

These multiple consciousness constitute a hierarchy with unified consciousness at the apex.</li>\n<li>We focus on visual consciousness because we know more about it compared to other perceptual systems and if we show that we are conscious of two attributes at different times, then this disproves that there’s a single unified consciousness.</li>\n<li>We start with the fact that the visual brain is functionally specialized for different visual features.</li>\n<li>E.g. Color and motion.</li>\n<li>Clinical evidence finds that lesions of V4 lead to achromatopsia, or color blindness, and lesions of V5 lead to akinetopsia, or motion blindness.</li>\n<li>Crucially, a lesion in one area doesn’t invade and disable the perceptual territory of the other.</li>\n<li>E.g. An achromatopsic patient still sees motion but not color.
