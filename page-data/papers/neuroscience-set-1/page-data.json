We call the relation between visual signals and spike trains a code to mean that spike trains specify/encode visual signals. - One can theoretically reconstruct the original message (visual signals) from the encoded message (spike trains), a process called decoding. - E.g. It’s this sense that neurons in the primary visual cortex encode the orientation of bars in their firing rate and that neurons in the hippocampus encode the animal’s location in place and grid cells. - Not all cases of correlations in nature are considered instances of coding. - E.g. Climate scientists don’t say that rain encodes atmospheric pressure. - Another assumption is that spike trains are considered messages for a reader, the brain, about the original message. - This is the representational sense of the metaphor. - Neural coding as a metaphor implies a causal relation between the original message and the encoded message. - E.g. Spike trains result from visual signals and not the other way around. - To be a representation for a reader, the neural code must at least have a causal effect on the reader.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 772px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/484e4997f8dd283f809e8b7f2d819cf7/940c5/figure1-2.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 111.6%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Figure 1\"\n        title=\"Figure 1\"\n        src=\"/static/484e4997f8dd283f809e8b7f2d819cf7/940c5/figure1-2.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/484e4997f8dd283f809e8b7f2d819cf7/63868/figure1-2.png 250w,\n/static/484e4997f8dd283f809e8b7f2d819cf7/0b533/figure1-2.png 500w,\n/static/484e4997f8dd283f809e8b7f2d819cf7/940c5/figure1-2.png 772w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></li>\n<li>Three elements of the neural coding metaphor summarized\n<ul>\n<li>Correspondence</li>\n<li>Representation</li>\n<li>Causality</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Most technical work on neural coding uses the first technical sense where the word “code” is used as a synonym for “correlate”.</li>\n<li>Paper argues that scientific claims based on neural coding rely on the representational or causal sense of the metaphor, but that none of these two senses is implied by the technical sense (correspondence).</li>\n<li>In other words, a correspondence or correlation doesn’t mean representation or causality.</li>\n<li>Coding variables that are shown to correlate with stimulus properties depend on the experimental context, therefore, neural codes don’t provide context-free symbols.</li>\n<li>And we can’t extend the neural code to represent a larger set of properties, such as the context, because context is what defines properties.</li>\n<li>Thus, neural codes have little representational power.</li>\n<li>The fundamental reason is that the coding metaphor conveys an inappropriate concept of information and representation.</li>\n<li>Neural codes carry information by reference to things with known meaning.</li>\n<li>E.g. Morse code only means something if you know that the dots and dashes refer to letters.</li>\n<li>However, perceptual systems have no option to refer to another thing for meaning so they build information from the relations between sensory signals and actions, forming a structured internal model.</li>\n<li>Another issue with the neural coding metaphor is that it tries to fit the causal structure of the brain (dynamic, circular, distributed) into the causal structure of neural codes (atemporal, linear) which doesn’t work.</li>\n<li>The author concludes that the neural coding metaphor can’t be the basis for theories of brain function because it’s disconnected from the causal structure of the brain and it’s incompatible with the representational requirements of cognition.</li>\n<li>The activity of neurons is often said to encode properties.</li>\n<li>E.g.

They say that there is sufficient information in the firing rates of individual neurons to produce ITD that are comparable with those of human psychophysically. - There is a skip between linking neural activity to behavior. Decoding the neural code isn’t done by the brain but by the experimenter. - By implying that the brain reads the neural code, we manage to make claims about perception and behavior while ignoring the mechanisms by which behavior is produced. - These claims rely on implicit linking propositions based on abstract constructs, where neural activity is likened to computer memory that the brain stores, retrieves, and manipulates, wherever it’s in the brain and whenever it occurs.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 679px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/c6050cc8468592a01418b00d3ed6d7c1/1b747/figure3-3.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 121.2%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Figure 3\"\n        title=\"Figure 3\"\n        src=\"/static/c6050cc8468592a01418b00d3ed6d7c1/1b747/figure3-3.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/c6050cc8468592a01418b00d3ed6d7c1/63868/figure3-3.png 250w,\n/static/c6050cc8468592a01418b00d3ed6d7c1/0b533/figure3-3.png 500w,\n/static/c6050cc8468592a01418b00d3ed6d7c1/1b747/figure3-3.png 679w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 679px) 100vw, 679px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></li>\n<li>We should also be wary of populations of overwise neurons, such as in slope coding.</li>\n<li>In reality, tuning curves are defined for a specific experimental condition and aren’t context free.</li>\n<li>If neurons encode variables, then what encodes the definition of those variables?</li>\n<li>Perception and memory cannot just be about encoding stimulus properties because this omits the definitions of those properties and of the objects to which they are attached.</li>\n<li>The author argues that the coding metaphor conveys a particular notion of information, information by reference, and this kind of information is irrelevant to perception and behavior.</li>\n<li>How is it possible for the nervous system to infer external properties from neural activity if all that it ever gets to observe is that activity?

We don’t have a brain circuit for chess or driving.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Neural coding theory considers the relations between observables as redundant and that they should be eliminated.</li>\n<li>In contrast, the view discussed in the paper argues that relations constitute information.</li>\n<li>One way that the nervous system might build relations is by exploiting the “invariant structure” in sensory stimuli.</li>\n<li>E.g. When a sound is produced, the left and right ears receive a delayed version from each other. This property of “delay” is an invariant structure of sound because the ears are distanced apart.</li>\n<li>The sensory world is made up of random pairs of signals that follow particular laws that the listener can identify. This identification is called the “pick-up of information”.</li>\n<li>An interesting aspect of this alternative notion of information is that the topology of the world projects to the topology of sensory laws.</li>\n<li>E.g. Two different sounds produced by a source at the same position will produce pairs of signals that share the same property (the sensory law).</li>\n<li>This can be assessed without knowing what this property corresponds to in the world. We don’t know what the property is, we just know that the property is invariant.</li>\n<li>This can be implemented in neurons using Hebb’s law.</li>\n<li>For an external observer, the sensory laws convey the information that the delay is related to the source’s position.</li>\n<li>However, for the receiver, they don’t know what the sensory law conveys as nothing tells it what it is nor can it infer it from the message.</li>\n<li>The important point here is to focus on the perspective of the receiver. If we are in the place of the receiver aka the organism, we can’t infer what the sensory signal means.</li>\n<li>Now let us consider that the receiver can turn their head, now the receiver observes that there’s a lawful relation between a proprioceptive signal (the head’s position) and the observed delay.</li>\n<li>Now when the receiver observes sounds with a particular delay, it can infer that if it were to move its head, then the delay would change in a predictable way.</li>\n<li>For the receiver, the relation between acoustical delay and proprioception defines the spatial position of the source.</li>\n<li>We note that the perceptual inference involved here does not refer to a property in the external world (frog position), but to manipulations of an internal sensorimotor model such as head position.</li>\n<li>The kind of information available to an organism isn’t Shannon information (correspondence to external properties of the world) but internal sensorimotor models.</li>\n<li>Animals are interested in such models because they can be manipulated to predict the effects of hypothetical actions.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 774px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/d1755fa678c58af50b225eb54e0b119a/41d3b/figure4-3.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 108.80000000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Figure 4\"\n        title=\"Figure 4\"\n        src=\"/static/d1755fa678c58af50b225eb54e0b119a/41d3b/figure4-3.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/d1755fa678c58af50b225eb54e0b119a/63868/figure4-3.png 250w,\n/static/d1755fa678c58af50b225eb54e0b119a/0b533/figure4-3.png 500w,\n/static/d1755fa678c58af50b225eb54e0b119a/41d3b/figure4-3.png 774w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 774px) 100vw, 774px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></li>\n<li>While this type of model seems similar to predictive coding theory, it isn’t the same as those models map internal variables to observables, while this model is more akin to models in physics which form relations between observables (F = ma).</li>\n<li>Generative models aren’t the kind of internal models described in the previous section.</li>\n<li>The word “predictive” is another baggage term in neuroscience as it is used in the technical sense such as in predictive coding, where it means that a neuron’s firing correlates with its sensory inputs, but the term is also used to refer to how an organism forms behavioral predictions.</li>\n<li>There isn’t any indication of how a theory based on neural coding might explain anticipatory behavior.</li>\n<li>For memory, cell assemblies can’t be used to implement memory because they’re unstructured and, thus, can’t represent structured internal models.</li>\n<li>E.g.

In this model, the neuron’s firing indicated whether signals satisfy a particular sensory law.</li>\n<li>This model has been generalized with the concept of a “synchrony receptive field”, which is the set of stimuli that elicit synchronous responses in a given group of neurons.</li>\n<li>Although synchrony can represent relations, neither binding by synchrony nor synchrony receptive fields solve the general problem of binding, because only one type of relation can be represented by synchrony and only a symmetrical one.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 773px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/3112764ed063e2b80e6bb2fb26acde61/612f7/figure6-3.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 116.8%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Figure 6\"\n        title=\"Figure 6\"\n        src=\"/static/3112764ed063e2b80e6bb2fb26acde61/612f7/figure6-3.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/3112764ed063e2b80e6bb2fb26acde61/63868/figure6-3.png 250w,\n/static/3112764ed063e2b80e6bb2fb26acde61/0b533/figure6-3.png 500w,\n/static/3112764ed063e2b80e6bb2fb26acde61/612f7/figure6-3.png 773w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></li>\n<li>Neural coding theories generally rely on the representational sense of the metaphor, the idea that neural codes are symbols standing for the properties that the brain manipulates, but there’s no evidence that this sense is valid.</li>\n<li>Worse, there’s empirical evidence and theoretical arguments against it.</li>\n<li>The coding metaphor has a dualistic structure and separates the function of the brain into two distinct components\n<ul>\n<li>A component that encodes the world into the activity of neurons.</li>\n<li>A component that decodes that activity into an internal model.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The two components (encoding and decoding) are indistinguishable in behavior, because no behavior involves just one of them.</li>\n<li>The question “does the brain use a firing rate code or a spike timing code?” is the same as asking “does the brain use the BOLD code?”</li>\n<li>Neural codes based on averaging over trials don’t have causal powers because percepts are experienced now, not on average.</li>\n<li>Neural codes have much less representational power than generally claimed or implied.</li>\n<li>The causal structure of neural coding metaphor is incongruent/incompatible with the causal structure of the brain.</li>\n<li>So what else, if not coding?</li>\n<li>The author suggests to develop models of the full sensorimotor loop.</li>\n<li>E.g.

Mouse and monkey.</li>\n<li>Krogh’s principle: for a large number of problems, there will be some animals that will be the most convenient to study.</li>\n<li>E.g. Hodgkin and Huxley used the squid to understand the mechanisms behind AP generation because it has a huge axon (~1 mm diameter).</li>\n<li>Benefits of convergence (using only a few animal models)\n<ul>\n<li>Rapid development of tools to study model nervous systems.</li>\n<li>Standardization of animal procedures such as housing and breeding.</li>\n<li>Reduced costs and simplicity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Certain functions are specialized in few animals which makes studying the function difficult if we ignore them as model animals.</li>\n<li>E.g. Vocal mechanisms such as language and songs.</li>\n<li>Another benefit of studying a variety of model organisms is that they may have specialized functions that we would like to have or that we can compare ourselves to.</li>\n<li>E.g. Sound localization. Studying the barn owl has revealed that the neural computation for sound localization followed almost exactly the Jeffress model, which is based on coincidence detection of excitatory inputs arriving from both ears. Yet in rodents, the problem is solved in a different way, which is based on inhibitory inputs that adjust the temporal sensitivity of coincidence-detection neurons.</li>\n<li>The comparative approach serves as an extremely powerful tool to assess the validity of universal principles.</li>\n<li>What should a scientist looking 30 years into the future do?</li>\n<li>One can, and should, think carefully and select the model system for the scientific question, rather than feel compelled to select the scientific question for the model system.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 610px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/2c100019285222c0e022a27583bb9a5a/5aae9/figure1-3.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 145.6%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Figure 1\"\n        title=\"Figure 1\"\n        src=\"/static/2c100019285222c0e022a27583bb9a5a/5aae9/figure1-3.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/2c100019285222c0e022a27583bb9a5a/63868/figure1-3.png 250w,\n/static/2c100019285222c0e022a27583bb9a5a/0b533/figure1-3.png 500w,\n/static/2c100019285222c0e022a27583bb9a5a/5aae9/figure1-3.png 610w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Big data and the industrialization of neuroscience: A safe roadmap for understanding the brain?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Three major issues\n<ul>\n<li>Is the industrialization of neuroscience the soundest way to achieve substantial progress in knowledge about the brain?</li>\n<li>Do we have a safe “roadmap” based on scientific consensus?</li>\n<li>Do these large-scale approaches guarantee that we will reach a better understanding of the brain?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Paper emphasizes the contrast between the accelerating technological development and the relative lack of progress in conceptual and theoretical understanding in brain sciences.</li>\n<li>We may be letting technology-driven, rather than concept-driven, strategies shape the future of neuroscience.</li>\n<li>E.g.

When reportable processing isn’t followed with accurate metacognition and when a self-monitoring operation unfolds without being consciously reportable.</li>\n<li>Many computations don’t involve C1 nor C2 called the unconscious or C0 or short.</li>\n<li>Cognitive neuroscience confirms that complex computations such as face/speech recognition, chess playing, and meaning extraction can all occur unconsciously in the human brain, under conditions that yield neither global reportability nor self-monitoring.</li>\n<li>Unconscious processing (C0): Where most of our intelligence lies.\n<ul>\n<li>“We can’t be conscious of what we’re not conscious of.”</li>\n<li>We’re blind to our unconscious processes so we tend to underestimate them.</li>\n<li>E.g.

This is more compatible with our remarkable speed of error detection.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Human don’t just know things about the world, they also know that they know or that they don’t know.</li>\n<li>Meta-memory: humans can report feelings of knowing, confidence, and doubts on their memories.</li>\n<li>Meta-memory is thought to involve a second-order system that monitors internal signals to regulate behavior.</li>\n<li>It’s associated with prefrontal structures whose pharmacological inactivation leads to metacognitive impairment while sparing memory performance itself.</li>\n<li>Meta-memory is crucial to learning as it allows learners to develop strategies to improve memory encoding and retrieval.</li>\n<li>The human brain must also distinguish between self-generated versus externally-driven representations.</li>\n<li>E.g. Perceptions versus imaginations and memories.</li>\n<li>Infants also show evidence of C2 as they can communicate their own uncertainty to other agents such as hesitation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Dissociations between C1 and C2\n<ul>\n<li>C1 and C2 are largely orthogonal (double dissociation) and complementary dimensions of consciousness.</li>\n<li>Self-monitoring can exist for unreported stimuli (C2 without C1).</li>\n<li>E.g. Automatic typing. Subjects slow down after a typing mistake even when they fail to consciously notice the error.</li>\n<li>Consciously reportable contents sometimes fail to be accompanied with an adequate sense of confidence (C1 without C2).</li>\n<li>E.g. When retrieving a memory, sometimes it comes without any accurate evaluation of its confidence, leading to false memories.</li>\n<li>C1 and C2 can also work together but this requires a single common currency for confidence across different modules.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Endowing machines with C1 and C2\n<ul>\n<li>Endowing machines with global information availability (C1) would allow different modules to share information and collaborate to solve problems.</li>\n<li>E.g. Letting the rest of the car know that it’s low on gas could mean reducing gas consumption and speed.</li>\n<li>Old “black-board” systems used to try to model this aspect of cognition.</li>\n<li>To make optimal use of global information, a machine should also have a database of its own capacities and limits (C2) such as a self-monitoring system.</li>\n<li>An important element of C2 that’s received little attention is reality monitoring.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Paper argues that a machine endowed with C1 and C2 would behave as though it were conscious.</li>\n<li>E.g. It would know that it’s seeing something, would express confidence in it, would report it to others, could suffer hallucinations when its monitoring mechanisms break down, and may even experience the same perceptual illusions that we experience.</li>\n<li>Some readers may be unsatisfied with the way the paper “over-intellectualizes” consciousness and leaves aside the experiential component of consciousness.</li>\n<li>Does subjective experience escape a computational definition?</li>\n<li>In humans, the loss of both C1 and C2 covaries with a loss of subjective experience.</li>\n<li>E.g. Damage to the primary visual cortex may lead to a condition called “blindsight” where patients report being blind in the affected visual field. Patients can localize visual stimuli in their blind field but can’t report them (C1), nor can they assess their likelihood of success (C2) as they believe they are merely “guessing.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"the-unsolved-problems-of-neuroscience\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-unsolved-problems-of-neuroscience\" aria-label=\"the unsolved problems of neuroscience permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4574630/\">The unsolved problems of neuroscience</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Problems that are solved, or soon will be\n<ul>\n<li>How do single neurons compute?</li>\n<li>What is the connectome of a small nervous system, like that of C. elegans (300 neurons)?</li>\n<li>How can we image a live brain of 100,000 neurons at cellular and millisecond resolution?</li>\n<li>How does sensory transduction work?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Problems that we should be able to solve in the next 50 years\n<ul>\n<li>How do circuits of neurons compute?</li>\n<li>What is the complete connectome of the mouse brain (70,000,000 neurons)?</li>\n<li>How can we image a live mouse brain at cellular and millisecond resolution?</li>\n<li>What causes psychiatric and neurological illness?</li>\n<li>How do learning and memory work?</li>\n<li>Why do we sleep and dream?</li>\n<li>How do we make decisions?</li>\n<li>How does the brain represent abstract ideas?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Problems that we should be able to solve, but who knows when\n<ul>\n<li>How does the mouse brain compute?</li>\n<li>What is the complete connectome of the human brain (80,000,000,000 neurons)?</li>\n<li>How can we image a live human brain at cellular and millisecond resolution?</li>\n<li>How could we cure psychiatric and neurological diseases?</li>\n<li>How could we make everybody’s brain function best?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Problems we may never solve\n<ul>\n<li>How does the human brain compute?</li>\n<li>How can cognition be so flexible and generative?</li>\n<li>How and why does conscious experience arise?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Meta-questions\n<ul>\n<li>What counts as an explanation of how the brain works?

It feels like something to perform echolocation.</li>\n<li>We can even ignore bats and only consider humans.</li>\n<li>E.g. The subjective experience of a deaf or blind person isn’t accessible to us, nor the other way around.</li>\n<li>Such an understanding, beyond the level of language that is direct experience, may be permanently denied to us by the limits of our nature.</li>\n<li>From this, one might also believe that there are facts which couldn’t ever be represented or comprehended by human beings because our structure doesn’t allow us to operate with concepts of the requisite type.</li>\n<li>E.g. We can’t see ultraviolet light because the eye doesn’t capture ultraviolet light.</li>\n<li>The bat thought experiment suggests that there are facts that aren’t expressible in the human language.</li>\n<li>We can recognize the existence of such facts without being able to state or comprehend them.</li>\n<li>E.g. We know that people see red but we can’t state what it’s like to be seeing red.</li>\n<li>There’s a sense that phenomenological facts can be objective, in the case when the perceiver is sufficiently similar to the describer.</li>\n<li>E.g. Humans mostly have the same range of color vision so we can categorize them into red, green, blue, etc. which are objective.</li>\n<li>However, the more different from oneself the other perceiver is, the less success one can expect.</li>\n<li>If the facts of experience, what it’s like for the experiencing organism, are only accessible from one point of view, then it’s a mystery how the true character of experiences could be revealed in the physical operation of that organism.</li>\n<li>The physical operation of that organism, biology, is a domain of objective facts, the kind that can only be observed and understood from many points of view and by individuals with differing perceptual systems.</li>\n<li>There are no obstacles in describing an experience in neurophysiology.</li>\n<li>It may be more accurate to think of objectivity as a direction in which understanding can travel.</li>\n<li>E.g. The objectivity of “red” is less than the objectivity of “atom” because atom is further removed from a human viewpoint.</li>\n<li>It’s difficult to understand what could be meant by an objective description of an experience, since that removes the viewer from the experience.</li>\n<li>After all, what would be left of what it was like to be a bat if one removed the viewpoint of the bat?</li>\n<li>We appear to face a problem with psychophysical reduction.</li>\n<li>In other areas of science, the reduction of phenomena is a move in the direction of greater objectivity; towards a more accurate view of the real nature of things.</li>\n<li>This is done by reducing our dependence on individual points of view toward the object of investigation.</li>\n<li>We describe the phenomenon not in terms of its impression on our sense, but in terms of its more general effects and properties other than the human senses.</li>\n<li>E.g. To describe the phenomenon of “matter” means to go beyond our human senses into the atomic or sub-atomic realms of reality.</li>\n<li>Experience itself, however, doesn’t seem to fit this pattern.</li>\n<li>If subjective experience is only fully comprehensible from one point of view, then any shift to greater objectivity, meaning less attachment to a specific viewpoint, doesn’t take us nearer to the real nature of consciousness, it just takes us further away.</li>\n<li>Different species may both understand the same physical events in objective terms, but this doesn’t require them to understand the subjective experience of those events to the senses of another species.</li>\n<li>The reduction can only succeed if the species-specific viewpoint is left out from what is to be reduced.</li>\n<li>If we desire that a physical theory of mind must also account for the subjective character of experience, we must admit that we don’t know how to do so.</li>\n<li>Indeed, this appears as a contradiction, to objectify the subjective.</li>\n<li>The state of physicalism is similar to if a pre-Socratic philosopher said “matter is energy” because we don’t have an idea of how “what it is like to be a bat” might be true.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-baseball-outfielders-determine-where-to-run-to-catch-fly-balls\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a

Determine Where to Run to Catch Fly Balls</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>When a baseball is hit, the only useable information appears to be the optical trajectory of the ball; the changing position of the ball image relative to the background.</li>\n<li>Outfielder: the players in a baseball game that catch the ball.</li>\n<li>In theory, outfielders could derive the destination of the ball from an assumed parabolic trajectory, but research shows that observers are very poor at using such a purely computational approach.</li>\n<li>Also, air resistance, ball spin, and wind can cause trajectories to deviate from a parabolic curve.</li>\n<li>One hypothesis is that outfielders run along a path that simultaneously maintains horizontal alignment with the ball and maintains a constant change in the tangent of the vertical optical angle of the ball.</li>\n<li>In other words, the fielder can arrive at the correct destination by selecting a running path that keeps optical ball speed constant, achieving optical acceleration cancellation (OAC).</li>\n<li>OAC works even if the trajectory isn’t parabolic because it couples the fielder’s motion with that of the ball.\n<span\n

model is elegant but flawed because OAC solutions require the precise ability to discriminate accelerations, and evidence shows that people are poor at such tasks.</li>\n<li>Another issue is that OAC was tested on balls hit directly towards the outfielder and without sideways motion.</li>\n<li>However, outfielders consider balls hit directly at them to be harder to catch, not easier.</li>\n<li>From this, it seems that outfielders use their vantage outside the plane of the ball trajectory in a way that simplifies, rather than complicates, determination of ball destination.</li>\n<li>An alternative explanation is the linear optical trajectory (LOT).</li>\n<li>LOT proposes that the outfielder selects a running path that maintains linear optical trajectory for the ball relative to the home plate and background.</li>\n<li>The solution is based on maintaining a balance between vertical and horizontal optical angular change and requires no knowledge of distance to the ball or home plate.</li>\n<li>In LOT, the outfielder doesn’t allow the ball to curve optically toward the ground and requires them to continuously move more directly under the ball, guaranteeing travel to the correct destination to catch it.</li>\n<li>The LOT strategy discerns optical acceleration as optical curvature, a feature that observers are very good at

the paper’s experiments, the balls launched directly toward the fielder are a special case and requires a different strategy other than OAC and LOT.</li>\n<li>The results support the premise that outfielders use spatial, rather than just temporal, cues to initially guide them toward the ball destination point.</li>\n<li>Other cases where the optical angle to a target is maintained\n<ul>\n<li>Airplane pilots use spatial error-nulling to anticipate and maintain constant angular position relative to a target.</li>\n<li>Predators and organisms pursing mates commonly adjust their position to maintain control of relative angle of motion between the pair.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Findings suggest that baseball players use a similar spatial strategy.</li>\n<li>Once an outfielder establishes a LOT solution, they know they control the situation and that they will catch the ball, but they don’t know when.</li>\n<li>This explains why outfielders run into walls chasing uncatchable ball and why they don’t rush ahead to the ball’s destination point, choosing instead to catch the ball while running.</li>\n<li>LOT also explains why balls hit to the side are easier to catch as fielders can use their strong ability to discriminate curvature rather than resorting to their weak ability to discriminate acceleration.</li>\n<li>In short, the LOT strategy provides a simple and effective way to pursue and catch a target traveling with approximate parabolic motion in 3D space.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"the-newly-sighted-fail-to-match-seen-with-felt\"

A small spot of light not only includes intensity, but also the edge shape, size, curvature, and contrast.</li>\n<li>This paper uses a wide variety of visual stimuli to tease out the purpose of the retina and optic nerve, instead of just light spots.</li>\n<li>The authors found four separate operations on the image in the frog’s eye and each operation’s result is transmitted by a particular group of fibers.</li>\n<li>They’re also all nearly independent of the general illumination.</li>\n<li>Four operations\n<ol>\n<li>Sustained contrast detection</li>\n<li>Net convexity detection</li>\n<li>Moving edge detection</li>\n<li>Net dimming detection</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The first two are communicated on unmyelinated fibers and the last two are communicated on myelinated fibers.</li>\n<li>Sustained contrast detectors\n<ul>\n<li>Same as ON receptive fields</li>\n<li>If the sharp edge of an object (either lighter or darker than the background) moves into its field and stops, it spikes and continues spiking, regardless of the shape and size of the edge.</li>\n<li>In some fibers of this group, a contrast previously within the field is “remembered” after the light is turned off, as it will keep a low mutter of activity that isn’t present compared to if no contrast was there before.</li>\n<li>This isn’t because this group is very sensitive, as showing an edge in darkness doesn’t trigger this residual mutter.</li>\n<li>The authors were struck by the smallness of the resulting change as in very dim light, we still get the same response.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Net convexity detectors\n<ul>\n<li>To the authors, this group contains the most remarkable elements in the optic nerve.</li>\n<li>This group responds to a small object passing through the field and only responds as long as the object is in the field.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Moving-edge detectors\n<ul>\n<li>Same as ON-OFF receptive fields.</li>\n<li>Responds to any distinguishable edge moving through its receptive field.</li>\n<li>It responds only to a moving edge, not a stationary edge.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Net dimming detectors\n<ul>\n<li>Same as OFF receptive fields.</li>\n<li>The fastest conducting detectors.</li>\n<li>Darkening of a spot produces less response when it’s in the periphery of the field than when it’s at the center.</li>\n<li>The sensitivity of the OFF discharge to illumination increases with time.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Lastly, there’s a small group of afferent fibers that don’t seem to have distinct receptive fields.

Even though we evolved eyes for hunting, we now use them for reading or looking at screens.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Not all present-day biological features exist as a result of natural selection; they may be due to random chance.\n<ul>\n<li>E.g.

Hearts have the function of pumping blood because this effect explains the capacity of the body to achieve circulation of oxygen, which in turn helps the organism survive.</li>\n<li>It’s often pointed out that consciousness isn’t a unitary (or one) phenomenon, but rather a collection of phenomenon.</li>\n<li>Consciousness can refer to\n<ul>\n<li>Level: the state of consciousness.\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. Brain death, coma, general anesthesia, sleep, wakefulness.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Content: describes the continually changing phenomenal content.\n<ul>\n<li>Qualia, the experience of red, the experience of warmth.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Self: describes our sense of identity/uniqueness.\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. Our personal memories or our preferences/personality.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A conscious organism is one that’s capable of having conscious mental content.</li>\n<li>Many types of mental content can be either conscious or unconscious.</li>\n<li>E.g. The belief that the sun will rise in the morning can be implicitly or explicitly held.</li>\n<li>By separating out the level and contents of consciousness, the function that mental contents has can’t be inferred from the function of the organism’s level of conscious.</li>\n<li>In other words, the ability to have conscious content may serve a different set of functions for an organism than the fact that a particular sort of conscious content is present.</li>\n<li>Another key distinction is between primary and higher-order consciousness.</li>\n<li>Primary consciousness: the experience of the world.</li>\n<li>Higher-order consciousness (HOC): the observation that we aren’t only conscious, but that we are also conscious of being conscious.</li>\n<li>HOC is the process that includes our sense of self and our ability to explicitly construct past and future scenes.</li>\n<li>While in humans these two forms of consciousness almost always go together, it’s conceivable that primary consciousness could exist independently of HOC.</li>\n<li>E.g.

Not all conscious thinking is rational, and not all rational behavior is conscious.</li>\n<li>This dissociation between rational thinking and acting is strikingly shown in cases where subjects provide false (confabulatory) rationalizations for the cause of their actions.</li>\n<li>E.g. Split-brain patients.</li>\n<li>It’s often the result of a reasoning process, rather than the reasoning process itself, that shows up in conscious thought.</li>\n<li>This is probably not the function of consciousness as there’s a lot of evidence against it, such as the book ‘Predictably Irrational’.</li>\n<li>Damasio suggests that consciousness aids rational decision making by biasing decisions into certain ways to reduce the space of possibilities and the time and effort required to decide.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A recurring theme in theories of consciousness is that consciousness serves to integrate independent neural and cognitive processes.</li>\n<li>E.g. Global workspace theory (GWT) and integrated information theory (IIT).</li>\n<li>GWT\n<ul>\n<li>According to GWT, the primary function of consciousness is to provide behavioral flexibility.</li>\n<li>The GWT architecture allows an organism to rely more on mental simulation and on internal evaluation to select actions, reducing both energy use and risk.</li>\n<li>GWT also argues that by using mental simulations, GWT participates in an evolutionary trend towards increasing internalization of environmental representations that provides the advantage of freeing the organism from its immediate environment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Many behavioral observations have found that during the initial phases of learning a new skill, it requires conscious attention. But as learning progresses, the execution of the skill becomes increasingly automatic.</li>\n<li>This is consistent with fMRI results that showed a shift from widespread cortical involvement to predominantly subcortical activation in later learning phases.</li>\n<li>Another theory, the supramodular interaction theory, argues that the function of consciousness is to mediate interactive processing across subsystems to allow the organism to produce a single, adaptive, motor action.</li>\n<li>E.g. Some processes are consciously impenetrable, such as pupillary reflexes, heart rate, and peristalsis (intestinal muscle movement), while other processes are consciously penetrable, such as inhaling, coughing, and swallowing.</li>\n<li>Other possible functions of consciousness\n<ul>\n<li>To detect and correct prediction errors.</li>\n<li>To infer the mental contents of others and thus improve social interactions.</li>\n<li>To simulate the consequences of actions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"thinking-about-the-brain\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#thinking-about-the-brain\" aria-label=\"thinking about the brain permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/24965297\">Thinking about the Brain</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>When approaching a new discipline, it’s useful to separate the topics that appear to be capable of explanation from those that don’t.</li>\n<li>Neuroanatomy, neuropharmacology, and neurophysiology fall under the first class, while perception, emotion, and consciousness fall under the second class.</li>\n<li>Curiously, the problem of building a visual picture requires little effort on our part compared to other mental tasks such as learning math.</li>\n<li>Review of the brain and computer analogy.\n<ul>\n<li>Computer is fast and serial, brain is slow and parallel.</li>\n<li>Computer is reliable but susceptible to damage, brain is unreliable but tolerant to damage.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The physical layout of neurons in the brain isn’t particularly neat.</li>\n<li>E.g.

needs at most 150 ms to perform this highly demanding task.</li>\n<li>The color photographs include a wide range of animals (mammals, birds, reptiles, fish) in their natural environment and the rest of the photographs have distractors like mountains, flowers, and fruit.</li>\n<li>The average proportion of correct responses was 94%.</li>\n<li>The range of reaction times on ‘go’ trials was from 382 ms to 567 ms, with median of 445 ms.</li>\n<li>This remarkable level of performance was possible despite the very brief presentations, which rules out the use of eye movements during image processing.</li>\n<li>The go/no-go trials diverge sharply at around 150 ms after stimulus onset.</li>\n<li>The effect was clear at frontal recording sites and was characterized by a near linear increase in the voltage difference over the following 50 ms or so, with the potential being more negative on no-go trials.</li>\n<li>There was no correlation between behavioral reaction time and the onset latency for the different responses.</li>\n<li>There was a correlation between median reaction time and percentage correct, showing a speed-accuracy tradeoff.</li>\n<li>What produces the early differential activity?</li>\n<li>Presumably, the difference must be related to some sort of decision-related activation that occurs only after the necessary visual processing is done.</li>\n<li>The most plausible explanation is that the difference isn’t generated by ‘go’-related neural activity, but rather by neural activity that is specifically generated on ‘no-go’ trials.</li>\n<li>The presence of ‘no-go’ activity at frontal recording sites at 150 ms implies that a lot of visual processing must’ve been completed before this time.</li>\n<li>While it’s relatively easy to detect if an animal is present, such as seeing eyes or feathers, having ‘no-go’ activity implies that the visual system has already performed enough processing to conclude that no animal is present anywhere in the image.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"spike-arrival-times-a-highly-efficient-coding-scheme-for-neural-networks\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a

networks</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The speed that visual processing occurs at in the human brain puts heavy constraints on the way information is processed.</li>\n<li>Given that visual processing is so fast, the only way it can be achieved is by using a single feed-forward pass through the visual system.</li>\n<li>Paper’s argument\n<ul>\n<li>Neurophysiological data shows that neurons in the temporal cortex have latencies around 100-140 ms.</li>\n<li>Anatomically, there appear to be at least 10 synaptic stages between the photoreceptors of the retina and the visually responsive neurons in the temporal lobe (2 in retina, 1 in LGN, 2 each in V1, V2, and V3, and 1 in IT cortex).</li>\n<li>Since the 10 synaptic layers must be crossed in 100 ms, this implies the each layer has only an average of 10 ms of processing time.</li>\n<li>Given that the firing rates of cortical neurons are in the range of 0 to 100 spikes per second, it follows that neurons in any given layer can only generate 1-2 spikes before neurons in the next layer have to respond.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>This puts major constraints on the way information is encoded.</li>\n<li>E.g. It’s unreasonable to propose that firing rate can be used as an accurate code because that would take too long (since neurons would need multiple spikes to determine the rate).</li>\n<li>One possibility is that with two spikes, one can use the interval between them as a code.</li>\n<li>E.g. The closer the spikes, the stronger the activation.</li>\n<li>However, evidence indicates that a large amount of information can be transferred using only one spike per neuron.</li>\n<li>Author proposes a new way of coding information in neural networks; that information is encoded by the relative arrival time of spikes.</li>\n<li>It’ll also be shown how such a scheme allows for very rapid resolution of the classic “Winner-takes-all” problem.</li>\n<li>Spike arrival time hypothesis\n<ul>\n<li>It’s known that the time taken for a neuron to reach its threshold for generating a spike depends on the strength of the stimulus.</li>\n<li>E.g. The stronger the stimulus, the faster the depolarization, and the sooner the spike.</li>\n<li>Imagine what happens when an image is flashed onto the retina.</li>\n<li>If the cells in the retina are sensitive to local intensity, a wave of spikes will be generated in the optic nerve, with the leading spikes corresponding to the points on the retina where the intensity is highest.</li>\n<li>As a result, even if each retinal cell generated only one AP, the complete intensity distribution of the image could be coded by the relative timing of spikes in the different fibers of the optic nerve.</li>\n<li>This isn’t biologically realistic, as retinal ganglion cells don’t simply code the local intensity, but rather local contrast.</li>\n<li>Nevertheless, the argument is the same.</li>\n<li>However, for this encoding to be useful, the next processing layer must make use of such information.</li>\n<li>It could use synaptic veto mechanisms where if a spike from one input arrives before another, then it could block the transmission of the second spike.</li>\n<li>It’s also known that the auditory system is sensitive to the relative arrival times of APs in determining spatial location.</li>\n<li>The differences in spike arrival time are due to timing differences in the arrival times of the actual physical stimuli.</li>\n<li>What’s being proposed here is that the nervous system could make use of differences in spike arrival times resulting not from temporal differences in the stimulus itself, but rather the delays introduced by the coding.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Problem of continuous input\n<ul>\n<li>A briefly flashed image onto the retina isn’t the same as a continuously changing input.</li>\n<li>Maybe eye movements (saccades) synchronize APs coming from the retina, or maybe there’s some other synchronization mechanism in the brain.</li>\n<li>Personally, I believe the brain handles it asynchronously.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Applying to the “Winner-Takes-All” problem - Suppose we have an array of inputs of varying levels of activity and we want to select only the most active one. - One way is to introduce inhibition so that the most active unit inhibits all others. - However, this requires a lot of iterations which will take time. - If we use relative spike arrival time, we can solve this problem using just one inhibitory neuron.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;

comparable to the chimpanzee.</li>\n<li>During evolution, dolphins may have increased the computational performance of their ‘simple’ neocortex by the multiplication of relevant structures (increasing surface area), instead of increasing its complexity.</li>\n<li>Paper suggests that the evolution of the large dolphin brain was due to\n<ul>\n<li>Using sonar as a successful feeding strategy to support the increased metabolism of a larger brain.</li>\n<li>The pelvic girdle not limiting brain size at birth.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Particularly impressive for the dolphin brain is the size and gyrification of the neocortex, with a surface area surpassing that of human brains.</li>\n<li>The sound generator and auditory system of a dolphin may have been the primary factor for the evolutionary size increase of the brain.</li>\n<li>Auditory structures in the dolphin’s brain are generally large (analogous to our large visual structures).</li>\n<li>It’s speculated that the hypertrophy (enlargement/overgrowth) of the dolphin brain resulted from the animal’s need for greater precision and speed in processing sound, due to the increased speed of sound in water compared to air.</li>\n<li>This hypertrophy correlates with the large diameter of the auditory nerve fibers, the short latency in auditory brainstem responses, and the rapid temporal resolution of successive sounds.</li>\n<li>In dolphins, the need for great precision and speed in processing sound, the highly cognitive capabilities, the hypertrophic cerebrum, and the extended gyrification of the cerebrum seem to be in paradoxical contrast to the thin neocortical plate.</li>\n<li>Dolphin neocortical grey matter is characterized by\n<ul>\n<li>The absence of layer IV</li>\n<li>Poor granulation with the predominance of large isodendritic stellate cells</li>\n<li>Well developed layers I and VI</li>\n<li>An accentuated layer II</li>\n<li>A high number of pyramidal neurons in layers II and VI</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>These characteristics seem to represent a primitive mammalian brain.</li>\n<li>Although neuron density is low in the dolphin neocortex, synaptic density is high and the absolute number of synapses is similar to that in humans.</li>\n<li>The total number of neurons in the neocortex of the bottlenose dolphin and the false killer whale is similar to the chimpanzee.</li>\n<li>It’s possible that the high absolute number of neurons and the high number of synapses in dolphins contributes to their strong cognitive capabilities.</li>\n<li>The ability to perform precise and fast sound processing and the highly cognitive capabilities may be possible due to the expansion of the neocortex, instead of the development of a more complex one.</li>\n<li>This was probably a neurobiological alternative to the situation in primates.</li>\n<li>The size of the dolphin brain doesn’t seem to be in paradoxical contrast to the ‘simple’ neocortical architecture but rather the result of an evolutionary alternative solution to improve its computational performance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2

To predict the next sensory input, a patch of neocortex must know where a sensor will be on the object after a movement is completed.</li>\n<li>And this location prediction must be done on a sensor-by-sensor basis because each sensor will feel a different location and feature.</li>\n<li>Theoretical requirements for a generated location signal\n<ul>\n<li>To translate an egocentric motor signal into a predicted allocentric location, a column must also know the orientation of the object relative to the body part doing the moving.</li>\n<li>Current location + Orientation of object + Movement >= Predicted new location</li>\n<li>While this is a complicated task, grid cells show that it’s possible for neurons to perform.</li>\n<li>Grid cells use the current location, head direction cells, and movement to predict a new location.</li>\n<li>This is same information that’s needed to predict a location.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>These analogs, plus the fact that grid cells are evolutionarily older than the neocortex, leads us to hypothesize that this mechanism was preserved and replicated in the sub-granular layers of each cortical column.</li>\n<li>While we don’t have direct evidence that each cortical column has grid-cell like functionality, we do know that numerous cortical areas are modulated by body movement and position.</li>\n<li>In this model, inhibition plays a role in that mini-columns mutually inhibit each other.</li>\n<li>Cells that spike first prevent other nearby cells from firing, and this requires a very fast, winner-take-all type of inhibition among nearby cells.</li>\n<li>Traditionally, it’s been assumed that as sensory input ascends the sensory processing hierarchy, cells respond to larger areas (receptive fields) and to more complex features.</li>\n<li>This assumes that complete objects can only be recognized at the top of the hierarchy where cells respond over the entire sensory array.</li>\n<li>The model presented here, however, proposes that all cortical columns are capable of learning representations of complete objects.</li>\n<li>Hierarchy is still incorporated into the model as larger stimuli that covers many receptive fields still requires converging input onto a higher cortical region to recognize.</li>\n<li>Thus, the cortex learns multiple models of objects, both within a region and across hierarchical levels.</li>\n<li>This model also fits more into the ‘what’ visual pathway for object recognition and it’s unsure how it fits into the ‘where’ visual pathway.</li>\n<li>Does this model apply to other sensory modalities, not just somatic sensation?</li>\n<li>Yes, this model is indifferent to the underlying sensory modality.</li>\n<li>The more powerful observation is that the anatomy supporting this model exists in most, if not all, cortical regions.</li>\n<li>This suggests that no matter what kind of information a region is processing, its feedforward input is interpreted in the context of a location.</li>\n<li>This may also explain why it’s easier to remember things when they’re associated with physical locations, and why we often use mental imagery to convey abstract concepts.</li>\n<li>The paper also has a list of testable predictions such as cells in sensory regions should be stable over movements. I like this section/list but it’s too long to list here.</li>\n<li>This paper focuses on how the brain makes predictions of sensory inputs.</li>\n<li>The premise is that all sensory regions make predictions of their constantly changing input based on a location signal representing where on an object the column is sensing.</li>\n<li>Although there are many things we don’t understand, the big picture is clear.</li>\n<li>Authors believe that each cortical column learns a model of its world and by connecting these columns, they can resolve ambiguity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"a-case-of-unusual-autobiographical-remembering\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#a-case-of-unusual-autobiographical-remembering\" aria-label=\"a case of unusual autobiographical remembering permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/13554790500473680\">A Case of Unusual Autobiographical Remembering</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Paper describes the case of AJ, a woman whose remembering dominates her life.</li>\n<li>Her memory is “nonstop, uncontrollable, and automatic.”</li>\n<li>AJ differs from other cases of superior memory in that it’s automatic and includes vast amounts of irrelevant information.</li>\n<li>Authors propose a new condition called “hyperthymestic syndrome” to describe AJ; the over-remembering syndrome.</li>\n<li>For AJ, memory has ruled her life and is like a sixth sense, always present like a split screen.</li>\n<li>AJ is 34 years old and since she was 11, she’s had an unbelievable ability to recall her past.</li>\n<li>Whenever she sees a date, she automatically goes back to that day and remembers where she was, what she was doing, what day it fell on, etc.</li>\n<li>It’s become clear that AJ’s memory is different from other cases of superior memory as she isn’t gifted at encoding and retrieving long strings of digits and numbers.</li>\n<li>In contrast to the vast literature on impaired memory and amnesic syndrome, little is known about forms of superior memory.</li>\n<li>Previous superior memory studies have focused on learning long lists of words/digits but none have reported superior autobiographical memory.</li>\n<li>The current view of superior remembering is that their skills are due to the application of strategies acquired through practice, and not through innate abilities.</li>\n<li>AJ differed in this regard as she couldn’t consciously apply strategies to help her learn and retain new information.</li>\n<li>E.g. AJ couldn’t use her talents in school and she had great difficulty with rote memorization.</li>\n<li>AJ described her memory as automatic, not strategic.</li>\n<li>The researchers used a variety of tests to explore her superior autobiographical memory.</li>\n<li>To verify her memory, AJ provided diaries detailing past events from age 10 to 34.</li>\n<li>AJ had grades of mostly Cs with some Bs and an A here and there. She didn’t like and wasn’t good at school and had to study hard.</li>\n<li>AJ reported migraines since childhood, taking medication to prevent headaches.</li>\n<li>AJ’s recall of events from her past is immediate, confident, and with considerable emotion.</li>\n<li>When asked to recall all Easter dates from 1980 onward, she produced all but one date accurately and with what she was doing on that day.</li>\n<li>When tested again two years later, she produced the same list but with the incorrect date corrected and with the same descriptions, matching the previous list and her diary entries, which demonstrates perfect reliability.</li>\n<li>She was able to recall an event given a date, and a date given an event, if the questions were within her areas of interest and the period of her good memory (around 14 years old and onward).</li>\n<li>AJ has a highly developed knowledge of dates and her mental calendar is impressive.</li>\n<li>However, if the date falls outside of that calendar, then she has trouble with it.</li>\n<li>E.g. She couldn’t answer what day of the week April 3, 1955 fell on.</li>\n<li>In contrast to AJ’s strong autobiographical memory and her ability to recall dates and events, she isn’t a gifted memorizer.</li>\n<li>The researchers also tested if her recognition would be better than her free recall and found that it wasn’t.</li>\n<li>How paradoxical that someone with such a powerful autobiographical memory was unable to recall or recognize the details of a videotape recording from a month before.</li>\n<li>Her autobiographical memory, while incredible, is also selective and even ordinary in some respects.</li>\n<li>Her general memory index on the WMS-R is 122, 29 points above her IQ.</li>\n<li>Traditionally, amnesia is characterized by a 15 to 20 decrement between general memory and IQ, so AJ’s memory is quantitatively superior.</li>\n<li>However, we should also remember that neuropsychological tests of memory are designed to measure impairments, not superior memory, and there can be ceiling effects due to the limited capacity to measure high levels of performance.</li>\n<li>AJ’s memory superiority is seen on tests of episodic memory, particularly when she is provided with some degree of structure in the material at encoding and/or at retrieval.</li>\n<li>However, AJ’s scores below average on tests of executive functioning and reasoning, anterior left hemisphere functions, organizationally demanding memory tests, and memory for faces.</li>\n<li>Like another case of superior memory, AJ was not strong in analogical reasoning and had a tendency toward concrete, rather than abstract, answers.</li>\n<li>Tests suggest a left hemisphere dysfunction, with issues in providing linguistically precise responses to questions, impaired facial memory, and a significant loss of detail in AJ’s recall.</li>\n<li>The tests that she doesn’t do well in are unstructured and require considerable abstraction, hypothesis formulation, and conceptual shifting.</li>\n<li>The following discussion weaves threads from separate approaches to offer the reader hypotheses about AJ’s form of extraordinary memory.</li>\n<li>The first important point is that maybe AJ is tricking the researchers or faking it all.</li>\n<li>How do we know that she isn’t rehearsing, practicing, and preparing to fool the researchers?</li>\n<li>She can’t prepare in advance since she didn’t know the dates and events prior to testing.</li>\n<li>Another argument against AJ faking are her scores on memory tests, as it would have been difficult to fake such a profile (set of scores).</li>\n<li>Most of us wouldn’t be able to retrieve what we were doing five years ago from this date, but AJ can.</li>\n<li>Give her an opportunity to recall one event and there is a spreading activation of recollection from one island of memory to the next.</li>\n<li>Two defining features of hyperthymesia\n<ul>\n<li>The person spends an abnormally large amount of time thinking about his or her personal past.</li>\n<li>The person has an extraordinary capacity to recall specific events from their personal past.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Why does AJ have an extraordinary good memory for some things and not for others?</li>\n<li>AJ, while of average intelligence, has significant deficits in executive functions involving abstraction, self-generated organization, and mental control.</li>\n<li>Although AJ isn’t autistic, there are certain similarities such as an interest in dates, repetitive and obsessive tendencies, and a highly variable neuropsychological profile with areas of superiority co-existing with areas of deficit.</li>\n<li>AJ doesn’t calculate the day of the week given a calendar date, but rather uses raw memory to know.</li>\n<li>Evidence for this is because she doesn’t know the day of the week outside of her personal experience, something calculations aren’t limited by.</li>\n<li>AJ’s hyperthymistic syndrome may be a case of highly superior semantic autobiographical memory.</li>\n<li>It’s somewhat surprising that superior memory doesn’t necessarily facilitate other aspects of everyday life, such as school.</li>\n<li>It’s worth questioning just what forms of superior memory benefit everyday functioning.</li>\n</ul>","tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#could-a-neuroscientist-understand-a-microprocessor\">Could a
