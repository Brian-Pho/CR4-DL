Color, form, motion, detail.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Processing these representations</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Many aspects of the world could benefit from an information-processing point of view.</li>\n<li>To understand a device that performs an information-processing task, one needs many different kinds of explanations at different levels.</li>\n<li>E.g. From the level of a layperson to amateur to expert.</li>\n<li>To understand vision, there is no single equation or viewpoint that explains everything.</li>\n<li>In some ways the brain is a computer, but an understanding of computers differs from an understanding of computation.</li>\n<li>Review of Shepard and Metzler’s mental rotation experiment and how there’s a linear relationship between rotation angle and time to decide whether a pair of blocks is identical.</li>\n<li>Review of Adrian and colleagues work on recording voltage changes in peripheral nerves.</li>\n<li>Their investigations showed that the character of the sensation depended on which fiber carried the message and not on how the fiber was stimulated.</li>\n<li>Thus, peripheral nerve fibers are thought to perform a simple mapping between physical events and a copy of them in the nervous system.</li>\n<li>Review of discovering the receptive field and Barlow’s work on the frog retina.</li>\n<li>The prevailing belief of neuroscience research during the 1950s and 60s was that the nervous system could be understood by functional analysis of its structure.</li>\n<li>E.g. Psychophysics provided phenomena that needed explaining, anatomy constrained these explanations, and neuroscience combined the two.</li>\n<li>But somewhere underneath, something was going wrong.</li>\n<li>The problem was that no neurophysiologist had recorded new and clear correlates of high-level perceptions.</li>\n<li>Research instead focused on neuroplasticity or on a more thorough analysis of what had already been discovered.</li>\n<li>What we lack is an understanding of why the brain is the way it is.</li>\n<li>This lack of understanding meant that we could not reverse engineer features of the brain.</li>\n<li>E.g. If we discover a neuron that detects hands, we couldn’t explain how it does so, why, or how to construct one.</li>\n<li>At the time, the business of neuroscience was to describe the behavior of cells, not to explain them.</li>\n<li>What is missing is analyzing the problem as an information-processing task; as independent of the mechanisms and structures that implement them.</li>\n<li>This level of analysis doesn’t overwrite the other levels of understand but complements them.</li>\n<li>By separating explanations into different levels, we achieve a more rigorous theory.</li>\n<li>A complex system is almost never understood as a simple extrapolation from the properties of its elementary components.</li>\n<li>E.g. Gas molecules aren’t described in terms of temperature, pressure, density for each particle. Instead, they’re described at the level of a collection of particles.</li>\n<li>To understand complex systems, one must contemplate different kinds of explanation at different levels of descriptions linked into a cohesive whole.</li>\n<li>Representation: a formal system for making explicit certain entities or types of information, together with a specification of how the system does this.</li>\n<li>Description: the result of using a representation to describe an entity.</li>\n<li>E.g. We can represent numbers using Arabic, Roman, or binary descriptions.</li>\n<li>The notion that one can capture some aspect of reality by making a description of it using a symbol is both a fascinating and powerful idea.</li>\n<li>Representations make trade-offs because they make certain information explicit at the expense of other information.</li>\n<li>How information is represented can greatly affect how easy it is to do different things with it.</li>\n<li>E.g. Multiplication is easy to do with Arabic or binary numbers but not with Roman numerals.</li>\n<li>The first level is the computational theory.</li>\n<li>A computational theory of vision starts by explaining the underlying task, which is to reliably derive properties of the world from photons.</li>\n<li>Two features of a computational theory (why)\n<ul>\n<li>It contains separate arguments about what’s computed and why.</li>\n<li>The resulting operation is defined uniquely by the constraints it has to satisfy.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The next level is the algorithmic theory.</li>\n<li>Two features of an algorithmic theory (how)\n<ul>\n<li>A representation for the input and output of the process.</li>\n<li>An algorithm that transforms inputs to outputs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Three important points about the algorithmic level\n<ul>\n<li>There’s usually a wide choice of representation.</li>\n<li>The choice of algorithm depends on the choice of representation.</li>\n<li>The choice of hardware depends on the algorithm.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The third and last theory/level is for the algorithm to be physically realized.</li>\n<li>E.g. Addition can be carried out by hand or electronically.</li>\n<li>To understand an information-processing device is to understand it at these three levels.</li>\n<li>Three levels\n<ul>\n<li>Computational theory: what’s the goal of the computation?</li>\n<li>Representation and algorithm: how can this computation be accomplished?</li>\n<li>Hardware implementation: how can the representation and algorithm be physically realized?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Each of these levels are loosely coupled, but there’s often a wide range of choices at each level.</li>\n<li>Some phenomena may be explained at only one or two of the levels.</li>\n<li>Neuroanatomy is tied to the third level, the physical realization of the computation. Psychophysics is tied to the middle level, the algorithm and representation. Evolutionary neuroscience is tied to the first level, the reasons behind the computation.</li>\n<li>Although algorithms and mechanisms are more empirically accessible, the top level, the computational theory, is more important from an information-processing view.</li>\n<li>An algorithm is more likely to be understood by learning the nature of the problem being solved rather than by learning the mechanism that it’s implemented in.</li>\n<li>E.g. Trying to understand perception by studying only neurons is like trying to understand bird flight by studying only feathers.</li>\n<li>How does the brain maintain perceptions in everyday life even though sensations continually change?</li>\n<li>The problem of perception is to recover valid properties of the external world from sensory information.</li>\n<li>The visual systems of different animals also differ to suit their purpose and niche.</li>\n<li>Representational framework for deriving shape information from images\n<ul>\n<li>Image → Primal sketch → 2.5D sketch → 3-D model representation</li>\n<li>Chapters 2 to 5 expand on this framework</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"part-ii-vision\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#part-ii-vision\" aria-label=\"part ii

intensity values in an image\n<ul>\n<li>Geometry</li>\n<li>Reflectance of the visible surfaces</li>\n<li>Illumination of the scene</li>\n<li>Viewpoint</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In an image, all of these factors are mixed up and the purpose of early visual processing is to sort out which changes are due to what factors.</li>\n<li>Thus, it decomposes the image into four representations.</li>\n<li>This goal is achieved in two stages: primal sketch and 2.5D sketch.</li>\n<li>Primal sketch: representations of intensity changes, local geometrical structure, and illumination effects.</li>\n<li>2.5D sketch: processes that operate on the primal sketch to derive representations of the geometry of the visible surfaces.</li>\n<li>Both the primal sketch and 2.5D sketch are constructed in a viewer-centered coordinate frame hence the term “sketch”.</li>\n<li>The purpose of these representations is to provide useful descriptions of aspects in the real world.</li>\n<li>Thus, the structure of the real world plays an important role in shaping both the nature of the representations and the nature of the processes that derive and maintain them.</li>\n<li>Our first assumption is that the visible world is composed of surfaces where their reflectance reflects their spatial structure.</li>\n<li>Our second assumption is that the organization of a surface’s reflectance function is often generated by a number of different processes, each at a different scale.</li>\n<li>Our third assumption is that surface properties tend to be more similar to one another in their size, local contrast, color, and spatial organization than to other items on that surface.</li>\n<li>No notes on further Gestalt-like principles of vision.</li>\n<li>Primitives are used to capture and match the structure in an image, thus facilitating the recovery of information about the underlying geometry of the visible surfaces.</li>\n<li>Three stages of processing to derive the primal sketch\n<ol>\n<li>Detection of zero-crossings (intensity changes)\n<ul>\n<li>Intensity changes occur at different scales in an image so their optimal detection requires the use of different-sized operators.</li>\n<li>A sudden intensity change will result in a peak or trough in the first derivative or a zero-crossing in the second derivative.</li>\n<li>Zero-crossing: a place where the value of a function changes from positive to negative.</li>\n<li>The author and Hildreth argue that the the operator that captures the both of these features is the Laplacian operator on the 2D Gaussian distribution (<span

filters?\n2. Formation of the raw primal sketch\n- The author has been intentionally avoiding using the word “edge” to describe intensity changes because edge has a partly physical meaning that isn’t known at the level of intensity changes.\n- Three features in the world that give rise to intensity changes\n1. Illumination changes (shadows, light sources)\n2. Orientation or distance changes\n3. Surface reflectance changes\n- The primitives of the raw primal sketch are edges, bars, blobs, and terminations.\n- These primitives have attributes of orientation, contrast, length, width, and position.\n- You are aware of the raw primal sketch but not the zero-crossings that made it.\n- How are spatial relations represented?\n- No notes on using a bit map representation of an image for finding spatial relationships.\n- Most of the early spatial relationships examined are local, thus a bit map representation is more efficient.\n- For detecting certain aspects of local geometry, rough topographical representation and locally connected receptive fields can provides adequate machinery power.\n- Image properties useful for decoding surface geometry\n- Average local intensity\n- Average size of similar items\n- Local density of items\n- Local orientation\n- Local distances\n- Local orientation of similar items\n- Virtual line: a primitive between neighboring similar tokens that has orientation and length.\n- Virtual lines are used to represent the organization of images, not surfaces.\n- No notes on detecting light sources and transparency.\n3. Creation of the full primal sketch\n- Two goals of the full primal sketch\n1. Construct tokens that capture the larger-scale structure of the surface reflectance function.\n2. Detect various types of changes in the measured parameters associated with these tokens that may help in detecting changes in orientation and distance from the viewer.\n- In other words, the goals are to make tokens and to find boundaries.\n- To do so, we start with the raw primal sketch and select similar elements from it, grouping them together to form lines, curves, blobs, groups, and small patches.\n- This process is repeated recursively to capture spatial structure at scale with increasingly abstract properties being extracted.\n- With these primitives, we can learn about the geometry of visible surfaces.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-3-from-images-to-surfaces\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-3-from-images-to-surfaces\" aria-label=\"chapter 3 from images to surfaces permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 3: From Images to Surfaces</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Our goal is to understand how descriptions of the world may be efficiently and reliably obtained from images of it.</li>\n<li>Disparity: the relative difference in position an object casts on each of your retinas.</li>\n<li>As objects approach the viewer, the disparity increases.</li>\n<li>The brain is capable of measuring disparity and using it to create the sensation of depth.</li>\n<li>How does stereo vision work?</li>\n<li>It’s complicated and we don’t know.

Football, pyramid, leg, arm, tree trunk.\n- If the surface is smooth and if the three constraining assumptions hold for all distant viewing positions in any one plane, then the viewed surface is a generalized cone.\n- The axes of the cones can be recovered from the image because this helps to establish an object-centered coordinate system.\n- When recovering the geometry of the surface, the most important question is whether a contour is convex or concave.\n- It’s often difficult to distinguish convexities and concavities from purely local cues in a monocular image.\n- Note that occluding contours (shadows) are almost never surface contours.\n- The recovery of surface orientation from surface contours remains an unsolved problem.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Surface texture\n<ul>\n<li>We should be skeptical when assuming that texture holds power to determine the geometry of surfaces.</li>\n<li>The first problem is how to extract the uniform texture elements from an image.</li>\n<li>We must be careful to not postulate more mechanisms than the problems require.</li>\n<li>The analysis of texture is another topic in a somewhat unsatisfactory state.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Shading and photometric stereo\n<ul>\n<li>The human visual system incorporates some processes for inferring shape from shading.</li>\n<li>However, shading acts as only a weak determiner of shape.</li>\n<li>The best way to solve the shape-from-shading problem is to understand the reflectance map, which is how image intensities relate to surface orientation.</li>\n<li>Smoothness, the property that surface orientation changes slowly over distance, is the key condition needed to solve the shape-from-shading problem.</li>\n<li>However, even this solution is too complicated from a biological viewpoint.</li>\n<li>Our visual system seems to only use coarse shading information but not always correctly, which is probably why shading is easily overridden by other cues.</li>\n<li>No notes on photometric stereo or recovering shape from reflectance maps because it can’t have any biological significance.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Brightness, lightness, and color\n<ul>\n<li>Everything we’ve covered so far deals with changes in the reflectance and illumination on a surface to recover information about the geometry of the surface.</li>\n<li>Yet we haven’t mentioned anything about the nature of the surface itself, which has biological significance.</li>\n<li>E.g. Whether a fruit is ripe, what the object is, whether an insect is poisonous.</li>\n<li>It’s surprising how much perceived color depends on the reflectance of a surface and how little it depends on the spectral characteristics of the light that enters our eyes.</li>\n<li>E.g.
