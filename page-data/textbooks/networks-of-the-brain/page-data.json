How can we define them and measure their properties?</li>\n<li>Euler founded the field of graph theory, the mathematical study of networks/graphs.</li>\n<li>Over the last decade, the study of networks has expanded to much larger systems.</li>\n<li>This chapter introduces the basic terminology and methodology of network science and its mathematical foundation: graph theory.</li>\n<li>There are no equations in this book.</li>\n<li>Graph: a system composed of interconnected elements.</li>\n<li>Review of nodes (fundamental elements of the system), edges (direct connections between pairs of nodes), adjacency matrix (representation of a graph as a matrix).</li>\n<li>Edges can be undirected or directed, binary or weighted.</li>\n<li>Dyadic: pairwise or two nodes connected by an edge.</li>\n<li>One fundamental graph measure is the degree of a graph.</li>\n<li>Degree: number of edges connected to a node, with specific indegree and outdegree for directed graphs.</li>\n<li>Counting up all of the degrees from all nodes forms the degree distribution of the network.</li>\n<li>This distribution is useful for checking whether nodes are similar in degree or not.</li>\n<li>Node degree is fundamental because it has a significant impact on most other network measures and it’s highly informative of the graph’s network architecture.</li>\n<li>Assortativity: the correlation coefficient for the degrees of neighboring nodes.</li>\n<li>E.g. Positive assortativity means nodes link with nodes of similar degree while negative assortativity means high-degree nodes connect more with low-degree nodes and vice versa.</li>\n<li>The balance of node indegree and outdegree is an indicator of the way the node is embedded in the overall network, and whether the node is primarily a sender or receiver.</li>\n<li>Path: a sequence of unique edges and intermediate nodes.</li>\n<li>Walk: a sequence of nonunique edges and intermediate nodes.</li>\n<li>Cycle: a path that connects a node to itself.</li>\n<li>Connected: if all pairs of nodes are linked by at least one path of finite length.</li>\n<li>Distance: the length of the shortest path linking two nodes.</li>\n<li>It’s important to note that distance in graphs is a topological concept that doesn’t refer to the actual spatial separation of the nodes.</li>\n<li>All pairwise distances in a graph may be represented in a distance matrix.</li>\n<li>Nodes in the context of the brain can represent neural elements such as cells, cell populations, or brain regions.</li>\n<li>Edges in the context of the brain can represent synapses or pathways.</li>\n<li>The structure of the adjacency and distance matrices describes the pattern of communication within the network.</li>\n<li>Both long and short paths can have a weak or strong effect depending on the value of that path.</li>\n<li>However, most analyses focus on the shortest possible path (distance) between nodes since that path is likely the most effective for internode communication.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

This is a question that network science can answer.</li>\n<li>Another set of measures capture the capacity of the network to engage in global interactions that cross the boundaries of modules.</li>\n<li>Many global network measures are based on paths and distances between nodes.</li>\n<li>Path length: in binary graphs is the number of distinct edges along a path, while in weighted graphs is the sum of edge lengths along a path.</li>\n<li>To compute path length for weighted graphs, we have to transform edge weights to lengths.</li>\n<li>E.g. If an edge weight is 5, we’ll give the edge length the inverse so 1/5.</li>\n<li>Edge lengths are usually inversely related to edge weights since edge weights express the coupling strength between nodes, while edge lengths express their topological distance.</li>\n<li>E.g. A further node is weaker than a closer node.</li>\n<li>One of the most common global network measures used in brain networks is the path length, usually computed as the global average of the graph’s distance matrix.</li>\n<li>E.g. A short path length means that, on average, each node can be reached from any other node with a few edges.</li>\n<li>Once again, to properly interpret path length, we have to construct appropriate random networks and compare their path length to the actual path length.</li>\n<li>Global efficiency: the average of the inverse of the distance matrix.</li>\n<li>E.g. A fully connected network has maximal global efficiency since all nodes can be reached with only one edge, while a fully disconnected network has minimal global efficiency since no node can be reached.</li>\n<li>E.g. A low path length or a high efficiency means that pairs of nodes, on average, have short communication distances and can easily reach each other.</li>\n<li>Global connectivity measures\n<ul>\n<li>Path length</li>\n<li>Efficiency</li>\n<li>Communicability: a measure of global information flow based on the number of walks between nodes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Global connectivity measures are important because they capture the capacity of the network to pass information between nodes and modules.</li>\n<li>E.g. Shorter structural paths are composed of fewer edges, which generally allow for signal transmission with less noise, interference, and attenuation.</li>\n<li>Segregation and integration place opposing demands on how networks are made.</li>\n<li>E.g. Clustering and modularity, which are key to segregation, are inconsistent with integration. And integration, which is optimal only in a fully connected network that lacks any modules, is incompatible with segregation.</li>\n<li>This tension between local and global structure is one of the main themes in creating networks and results in the diversity of networks that we see in the brain.</li>\n<li>Not all nodes and edges are created equal as some nodes or edges impact the network more than others.</li>\n<li>E.g. Removing or disrupting that node or edge is more disruptive to the rest of the network than removing a random node or edge.</li>\n<li>These important nodes are often more densely connected to the network, which is why they play a critical role in the network.</li>\n<li>Hub: an important node as determined by several different criteria, the simplest being a node’s degree.</li>\n<li>In networks with a nonuniform distribution of node degrees, a hub is often essential for maintaining global connectedness. In uniform networks, a hub is less informative.</li>\n<li>Participation coefficient: a measure of how many diverse between-module connections a high-degree node has.</li>\n<li>Provincial hub: a high-degree node with few diverse between-module connections or a low participation coefficient.</li>\n<li>Closeness centrality: the inverse of the average path length between that node and all other nodes in the network.</li>\n<li>E.g. A node with high closeness centrality can reach all other nodes through short paths and thus exerts more influence over the network.</li>\n<li>Betweenness centrality: the fraction of all shortest paths in the network that pass through the node.</li>\n<li>E.g. A node with high betweenness centrality can control information flow because it’s at the intersection of many short paths.</li>\n<li>However, both of these centrality measures assume information flow to be biased towards shorter paths, but this assumption may not be true.</li>\n<li>Eigenvector centrality: accounts for interactions of different lengths and their dispersion, relying on walks rather than shortest paths.</li>\n<li>Eigenvector centrality hasn’t yet been widely used in biology or neuroscience.</li>\n<li>Centrality measures are useful because they identify elements that are highly interactive or that carry significant information in the network.</li>\n<li>E.g. Losing nodes or edges in a network with high structural centrality tends to have a larger impact on the function of the remaining network.</li>\n<li>Network architectures\n<ul>\n<li>Random graph\n<ul>\n<li>Start with a disconnected set of nodes and connect pairs of them with uniform probability.</li>\n<li>This results in nodes with a mostly uniform degree, short characteristic path lengths, and low levels of clustering.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Regular graph (lattice)\n<ul>\n<li>In contrast to random graphs, this class of graph has an ordered pattern of connections between nodes.</li>\n<li>E.g. Grid or ring structure.</li>\n<li>This results in a network with locally dense connections, higher clustering, and longer characteristic path lengths compared to random graphs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Random and regular graphs are idealized models of networks which allows for elegant formal description and analysis.</li>\n<li>However, most real-world networks aren’t as well structured as random or regular graphs.</li>\n<li>E.g. Most real-world networks aren’t as uniform, and the degree and influence of each node and edge varies.</li>\n<li>Small-world effect: a phenomenon where in a large network it’s often possible to connect two nodes by short paths.</li>\n<li>E.g. The world of social relationships is a small world because the path between two people is short.</li>\n<li>The key to building a small-world network, and the key difference between random and regular graphs, is the probability that an edge of the regular graph randomly rewires.</li>\n<li>E.g.

In protein interactions, deleting proteins corresponding to hubs is often lethal. In social networks, hubs are people who are highly connected and are often leaders.</li>\n<li>By virtue of their connections, hub nodes integrate many signals and can control the flow of information between other segregated parts of the brain.</li>\n<li>E.g.

Molecular guidance cues are involved in establishing topographic maps.</li>\n<li>Given that developmental mechanisms play a major role in shaping connectivity, what’s the role of development in theories of wiring minimizing?</li>\n<li>Maybe development plays a small role as connectivity features could have arose as a result of selecting for utility and adaptive advantage rather than as a result of developmental processes.</li>\n<li>Maybe development plays a big role as developmental processes directly contribute to conserved wiring patterns.</li>\n<li>Cherniak theory: neurons are placed at spatial locations that minimize their total wiring length.</li>\n<li>However, the placement of neurons isn’t independent of their connections because if two neurons are spatially close, then developmental mechanisms make it more likely that these neurons are also connected.</li>\n<li>Thus, developmental processes produce a bias for neurons to be connected because they’re adjacent, and not adjacent because they’re connected as suggested by Cherniak’s theory.</li>\n<li>Reanalysis of evidence supporting Cherniak’s theory suggests that wiring minimization can account for much of neuronal positioning, but there are some exceptions that violate the minimization rule.</li>\n<li>The exceptions are long-distance connections that span about 80 percent of C. elegan’s body and significantly decrease path lengths.</li>\n<li>Minimizing wiring cost comes at the expense of increased path lengths.</li>\n<li>Anatomical studies found an exponential decrease in connection probability with increasing spatial separation between cortical neurons.

Neuroreductionism: a view that fully substitutes all mental phenomena by neural mechanisms. This view implies that the fundamental properties of cells and molecules can explain all there is to know about the mind and cognition, and ignores emergent and collective properties.</li>\n<li>This chapter attempts to move beyond reductionist models of cognition and views the subject from the integrative perspective of complex networks.</li>\n<li>Two ways functional integration is achieved in the brain\n<ul>\n<li>Convergence</li>\n<li>Synchrony</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Cognition is a network phenomenon as it doesn’t exist in synapses or neurons.</li>\n<li>Instead, cognition is a collective property of a very large number of interconnected neural elements in complex patterns.</li>\n<li>Review of parallel distributed processing (PDP).</li>\n<li>The tension between models based on hierarchical versus distributed processing became apparent in anatomical and functional accounts of the visual cortex, prefrontal cortex, and a variety of other brain systems.</li>\n<li>The lack of a simple one-to-one mapping between anatomical regions and cognitive functions suggests that cognition and behavior are instead associated with networks of regions, each supporting a broad range of functions.</li>\n<li>A slightly different argument is that a complex function is instead a system of interrelated processes directed toward the performance of a particular task.</li>\n<li>In this view, the structural networks of the brain serve as a substrate for the system-wide dynamic coordination of distributed neural resources and implies that complex functions are achieved by transient/temporary assemblies of network elements.</li>\n<li>Thus, different processing demands and task domains are associated with the dynamic reconfiguration of functional or effective brain networks, where the same set of network elements can participate in multiple cognitive functions by rapid reconfiguration.</li>\n<li>Both of these perspectives lead to the idea that functions don’t reside in individual brain regions, but instead are accomplished by network interactions that rapidly reconfigure depending on the task demands and context.</li>\n<li>This reconfiguration is ultimately constrained by the underlying structural network.</li>\n<li>Regional activation is insufficient to indicate the involvement of the region with a task, and instead the functional contribution of a brain region is more clearly defined by the context that it’s used in.</li>\n<li>Network theories of cognition emphasize the cooperative processes that are shaped by anatomical connectivity.</li>\n<li>Thus, mapping between neurons and cognition is less about what individual nodes do and more on what the individual nodes are connected to (topology).</li>\n<li>One of the most important features of large-scale system dynamics is the coexistence of opposing forces, namely segregation and integration.</li>\n<li>This opposition comes from the existence of discrete anatomical units with regional specialization, and the unity of mental states and behavior.</li>\n<li>Segregation: the tendency of different neurons to capture different regularities in their inputs.</li>\n<li>Integration by convergence creates more specialized neurons or regions by taking inputs from other, less specialized neurons.</li>\n<li>Convergence thus creates neurons that encode high-level attributes of their respective input space, thereby increasing functional segregation and specialization of the architecture.</li>\n<li>An alternative implementation of integration by convergence is to have convergence zones that can trigger and synchronize distributed neural patterns through feedback projections, but themselves aren’t the center of integration.</li>\n<li>Integration can also be achieved without convergence by using dynamic interactions, phase locking, and synchronization between distant neural populations.</li>\n<li>This form of integration depends on reciprocal structural connections between segregated brain regions.</li>\n<li>Spontaneous or evoked changes in phase coherence and synchronization can rapidly reconfigure networks of functional and effective connectivity, while the underlying structural connectivity remains relatively unchanged.</li>\n<li>Hierarchy is an important feature of neurocognitive networks because it arranges neural units and brain regions where information flows from lower (sensory) to higher (multimodal and associative) levels, gradually becoming more complex.</li>\n<li>Recurrent feedback from higher to lower visual areas contributes to a loosening of the strictly serial hierarchy assumed of the visual cortex.</li>\n<li>Feedforward connections drive neural activity, while feedback connections mediate a range of modulatory synaptic effect.</li>\n<li>It’s been suggested that top-down feedback connections may provide predictions about bottom-up sensory inputs, supporting perception.</li>\n<li>Another definition of hierarchy that’s used in network science is as levels of modularity or as nested arrangements of modules within modules.</li>\n<li>Modularity and hub analysis can identify regions of high intermodal convergence (functional integration) and distinct processing streams (functional segregation).</li>\n<li>Structural and functional modules identified by network analysis have little relation to the cognitive modules proposed by Fodor and others.</li>\n<li>Structural, functional, and effective brain networks change on different time scales.</li>\n<li>E.g. Structural networks generally remain stable over short time scales, while functional and effective networks change rapidly due to spontaneous activity or in response to task demands.</li>\n<li>Varying task demands can rapidly and temporarily reconfigure functional networks while maintaining some of their topological characteristics.</li>\n<li>How do task demands change the functional connections among regions in the default mode network?</li>\n<li>We find that task demands and cognitive load results in deactivation of most of the default mode network, but doesn’t completely abolish it.

Bodily movement that causes changes in sensory inputs. In this case, the environment acts as a proxy between the motor and sensory regions of the brain.</li>\n<li>Coordination between parts of the brain can occur through the environment and doesn’t always need the nervous system.</li>\n<li>Viewed this way, the brain is a closed system where neural activity always leads to neural activity.</li>\n<li>Environmental interactions thus further expand the available set of functional brain networks.</li>\n<li>This chapter discusses the brain-body-environment interactions that can have profound effects on brain networks.</li>\n<li>Complex behavior can come from simple mechanisms expressed in a complex environment.</li>\n<li>E.g. The path of an ant seems complex, but this complexity is largely a reflection of the complexity of the environment that it’s in and not because of what goes on in the ant’s brain.</li>\n<li>Thus, complex behavior is the result of the interaction between brain, body, and environment, and this view is called embodied cognition.</li>\n<li>What embodied cognition models and robots have in common is that they act autonomously in the real world.</li>\n<li>Building such systems reveals the relationship between neural control, bodily action, and the effect it has on the environment.</li>\n<li>This shows the dependency of cognitive processes on sensorimotor interactions.</li>\n<li>Embodiment greatly expands the space of possibilities that evolution can use to increase an organism’s capacity to process information.</li>\n<li>Examples of active sensing\n<ul>\n<li>Echolocation in bats and dolphins</li>\n<li>Whiskers in rodents</li>\n<li>Olfactory cues in lobsters and crabs</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>These examples suggest that the full capacity of biological sensory systems is only revealed in their natural environment and with meaningful stimuli.</li>\n<li>Manipulating and playing with objects allows people to choose viewing angles that are most informative about object identity or that present frequently encountered patterns and features.</li>\n<li>Embodiment naturally generates correlations and redundancies across multiple sensory modalities, and multimodal correlations help disambiguate sensory inputs which reduces the dimensionality of the sensory space, thus supporting cognitive functions.</li>\n<li>Social networks and brain networks are interwoven and are adjacent levels of a multiscale architecture. Some of the same network principles may apply to both levels.</li>\n<li>The physical arrangement of sensory surfaces and motor structures is intricately linked to the processing capabilities of its neural network.</li>\n<li>It appears unlikely that the extraordinary capacity and flexibility of the human mind can be traced to any single morphological or genetic feature, or to a privileged brain region or pathway.</li>\n<li>Throughout this book, the author has argued for a network science approach to neural systems because it’s well suited for bridging the levels of organization in the nervous system.</li>\n<li>It’s networks all the way down.</li>\n</ul>","tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#chapter-1-introduction-why-networks\">Chapter 1: Introduction: Why Networks?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#chapter-2-network-measures-and-architectures\">Chapter 2: Network Measures and Architectures</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#chapter-3-brain-networks-structure-and-dynamics\">Chapter 3: Brain Networks: Structure and Dynamics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#chapter-4-a-network-perspective-on-neuroanatomy\">Chapter 4: A Network Perspective on Neuroanatomy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#chapter-5-mapping-cells-circuits-and-systems\">Chapter 5: Mapping Cells, Circuits, and Systems</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#chapter-6-the-brains-small-world-motifs-modules-and-hubs\">Chapter 6: The Brain’s Small World: Motifs, Modules, and Hubs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#chapter-7-economy-efficiency-and-evolution\">Chapter 7: Economy, Efficiency, and Evolution</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#chapter-8-dynamic-patterns-in-spontaneous-neural-activity\">Chapter 8: Dynamic Patterns in Spontaneous Neural Activity</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#chapter-9-networks-for-cognition\">Chapter 9: Networks for Cognition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#chapter-10-brain-network-disease\">Chapter 10: Brain Network Disease</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#chapter-11-network-growth-and-development\">Chapter 11: Network Growth and Development</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#chapter-12-dynamics-stability-and-diversity\">Chapter 12: Dynamics: Stability and Diversity</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#chapter-13-neural-complexity\">Chapter 13: Neural Complexity</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#chapter-14-brain-and-body\">Chapter 14: Brain and Body</a></li>\n</ul>","timeToRead":47,"frontmatter":{"title":"Networks of the Brain","date":"January 30, 2021","book_authors":"Olaf Sporns","categories":["Textbooks"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/textbooks/networks-of-the-brain/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/papers/neuroscience-set-1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Neuroscience Papers Set 1","layout":"post"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/textbooks/brain-architecture-understanding-the-basic-plan/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Brain Architecture: Understanding the Basic Plan","layout":"post"}}}},
