The equations describing movement applies to both cars and planets.</li>\n<li>When an analogy exists between underlying mechanisms, equations serve as the embodiment of that analogy.</li>\n<li>Biology, specifically neuroscience, has been slower to embrace mathematics compared to other fields.</li>\n<li>Simplifying a problem is what opens it up to mathematical analysis, which also means that some biological details get lost in the translation from data to equations.</li>\n<li>E.g. A farmer approaches a physicist with a problem related to cows.

Each side spoke separate languages and worked towards different goals.</li>\n<li>For most researchers, the question of how the brain creates the mind was not just unanswered, it was unasked.</li>\n<li>McCulloch was different in that he thought of the brain as a computing device, linking the brain to the rules of logic.</li>\n<li>McCulloch and Pitts explored how the biological details of neurons, such as whether they fire an AP or not, is similar to true/false in logic.</li>\n<li>E.g. One neuron fires if the animal looks like a duck, another neuron fires if the animal quacks like a duck. A third neuron combining both outputs fires if a duck is present.</li>\n<li>These networks representing real neurons became known as artificial neural networks (ANNs).</li>\n<li>McCulloch knew that neurons were much more complex than modeled in ANNs, but he intentionally highlighted the functions he thought were important for the model.</li>\n<li>Model-building is an art; it’s a subjective-creative process of choosing which facts belong and which facts don’t.</li>\n<li>In the years to follow, McCulloch would organize meetings between biologists and technologists such as Norbert Wiener and John von Neumann, creating the field of artificial intelligence.</li>\n<li>Review of Frank Rosenblatt and the perceptron.</li>\n<li>The perceptron was another model of neurons that could be connected together to form an ANN.</li>\n<li>However, the perceptron differs from the McCulloch-Pitts neuron model in that it can learn.</li>\n<li>McCulloch and Pitts specify that the connections between neurons are determined by the logical function carried out by the network; there’s no learning.</li>\n<li>In contrast, for the perceptron to learn, it must modify its connections, specifically the weights associated with those connections.</li>\n<li>The perceptron engages in supervised learning because it requires pairs of inputs and outputs.</li>\n<li>Differences between the network’s output and the desired output are used to change the connection weights, thus improving the network’s performance.</li>\n<li>E.g.

Imagine each neuron represents an object in a room such as a bike, a chair, and an elephant. To represent a memory, the neurons that represent all the objects in that room should be ‘on’ while the the neurons that represent all of the objects not in that room should be ‘off’.</li>\n<li>In associative memory, a small input to the network reactivates an entire memory state.</li>\n<li>If we think of memory in terms of dynamical systems, then an associative memory is an example of an attractor, a popular pattern of activity.</li>\n<li>The Hopfield network can sustain multiple attractors and thus multiple memories.</li>\n<li>Hopfield networks match our intuition about memory.</li>\n<li>E.g. The time it takes to retrieve a memory is the time it takes for the network to activate the right neurons. Attractors can slightly move, consistent with a memory that’s slightly distorted.</li>\n<li>Thus, the network represents how memories are stored. But how are memories formed in the first place? How are the connections in the Hopfield network determined?</li>\n<li>We can use Hebbian learning to encode a set of memories.</li>\n<li>E.g. For every experience, if two neurons are both active/inactive then the connection between them is strengthened/weakened.</li>\n<li>Neurons that are commonly co-active in memories will have a strong positive connection and those that have opposite activity patterns will have strong negative connections.</li>\n<li>One issue with the biological realism of Hopfield networks is that the connection weights are assumed to be symmetric.</li>\n<li>E.g. The weight from node A to B is the same as from node B to A.</li>\n<li>Another limitation is that Hopfield networks implement memory recall and not memory recognition.</li>\n<li>The ability to generate a memory from scratch, memory recall, is much harder than a feeling of familiarity when seeing a memory, memory recognition.</li>\n<li>Review of patient H.M. and his memory deficits.</li>\n<li>Current theories of hippocampal function\n<ul>\n<li>Information about the world first goes to the dentate gyrus where the representation is primed and prepped to be stored.</li>\n<li>From the dentate gyrus, the representation is sent to CA3 where attractors are believed to form since CA3 has extensive recurrent connections, making it a possible substrate for Hopfield networks.</li>\n<li>CA3 sends it output to CA1, which acts as a relay station to the rest of the brain.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 492px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/CR4-DL/static/1490430952fa634562d54aa101c51738/5c6e9/figure10.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 82.8%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Figure 10\"\n        title=\"Figure 10\"\n        src=\"/CR4-DL/static/1490430952fa634562d54aa101c51738/5c6e9/figure10.png\"\n        srcset=\"/CR4-DL/static/1490430952fa634562d54aa101c51738/63868/figure10.png 250w,\n/CR4-DL/static/1490430952fa634562d54aa101c51738/5c6e9/figure10.png 492w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>CA3 acts like a buffer or warehouse, storing memories until they’re copied to other brain areas.</li>\n<li>We believe it does this by reactivating the memory in those areas and by repeatedly reactivating the same group of neurons, the hippocampus uses Hebbian learning to store the memory.</li>\n<li>With his hippocampus gone, H.M. had no buffer for his experiences and thus no way to replay his memories back to his brain.</li>\n<li>Where are working memories stored in the brain and in what way?</li>\n<li>Lesion experiments hint at the prefrontal cortex for being responsible as damage to it substantially reduced working memory.</li>\n<li>Using delayed response tasks where an image is displayed, removed, and then displayed again, we can test what the prefrontal cortex is doing during the delay.</li>\n<li>Most brain areas responsible for vision have a stereotyped response to the delayed response task with strong activity when the image is displayed and when it reappears after the delay.</li>\n<li>But during the delay period, when no visual inputs enter the brain, these areas are mostly quiet.</li>\n<li>Out of sight really does mean out of mind for these neurons.</li>\n<li>However, neurons in the prefrontal cortex don’t follow this pattern as they maintained their activity during the delay period, suggesting that this is the physical implementation of working memory.</li>\n<li>What’s special about these prefrontal cortex neurons?

Common symbols can’t communicate much.</li>\n<li>Shannon captured this relationship between a symbol’s use and its information content by using probability.</li>\n<li>E.g. The amount of information decreases as the probability of the symbol increases and vice versa.</li>\n<li>Information is measured using the unit ‘bit’, which we can think of as the number of yes-no questions we need to ask to get an answer.</li>\n<li>E.g. If a signal contains 10 bits, we need 10 yes-no questions to get an answer.</li>\n<li>How do we maximize the information content of a message?</li>\n<li>We must use each symbol an equal amount.</li>\n<li>E.g. For five symbols, use each symbol one-fifth of the time. For one hundred symbols, use each one-hundredth of the time.</li>\n<li>Making each and every symbol equally likely balances the trade-off between rare and common communication.</li>\n<li>The more symbols a code has, the better because it can encode more information.</li>\n<li>One of the challenges in applying information theory to the nervous system comes from different beliefs on what parts of the nervous system map to the formal components of Shannon’s information theory.</li>\n<li>E.g. What is the nervous system’s symbol? What is the neural code?</li>\n<li>Instead of using only two symbols: spike or no spike, MacKay and McCulloch realized that using the time between spikes as the code allowed neurons to transmit much more information. This is now called temporal-based coding.</li>\n<li>Stein used a different approach, believing that the number and frequency of spikes is the code. This is now called rate-based coding.</li>\n<li>Neuroscientists continue to argue over the neural code to this day and the goal of identifying the neural code seems to grow more distant.</li>\n<li>Review of Lloyd Jeffress’s sound localization model that transforms a temporal code into a spatial code.</li>\n<li>As for why the neural code is such an enigma, the most likely answer is because it’s complicated.</li>\n<li>Some neurons in some brain areas may use a rate-based code, and other neurons in other areas may use a temporal-based code.</li>\n<li>The brain, it seems, speaks too many different languages.</li>\n<li>Regardless of the neural code, one strong guiding principle has been the efficient coding hypothesis: the idea that the nervous system always encodes information efficiently.</li>\n<li>Horace Barlow believed efficient brains reduce their redundancy to reduce the waste of resources such as energy.</li>\n<li>In the nervous system, redundancy can come from multiple neurons saying the same thing.</li>\n<li>How does the brain know if the information it’s receiving is redundant?</li>\n<li>Adaptation: when a sensory neurons reduces its firing rate to a constant stimulus.</li>\n<li>E.g. If you stare at something that’s constantly moving, like a waterfall, and then look away, stationary objects appear to be moving in the opposite direction.</li>\n<li>The effect is believed to come from the adaptation of neurons that represent the original motion direction. These cells are silenced by adaptation, leaving the cells representing the opposite direction to be active.</li>\n<li>If the same symbol is sent over and over, its presence no longer carries information.</li>\n<li>Adaptation ensures that all types of information are encoded efficiently.</li>\n<li>One issue with applying information theory to the brain is what aspect implements the decoder.</li>\n<li>E.g.

One set of neurons fires strongly when the wrist is flexed to the left and another set of neurons fires strongly when the wrist is flexed to the right.</li>\n<li>However, this experiment confounds wrist position and wrist force. To separate these two components, we can add a weight to the rod, thereby increasing force but leaving position unchanged.</li>\n<li>Evarts saw that 26 out of the 31 motor cortex neurons that he was recording from were clearly related to force.</li>\n<li>These results made a strong case for the argument that the motor cortex encodes force.</li>\n<li>Review of Apostolos Georgopoulos’s work and population coding.</li>\n<li>Georgopoulos changed Evarts’s perspective from asking what neurons were saying about muscles, to what they were saying about movement.</li>\n<li>He found that more than a third of the neurons in the motor cortex showed a clear and simple relationship between neural activity and the direction the arm was moving.</li>\n<li>In essence, these neurons had a preferred direction.</li>\n<li>This finding of ‘direction tuning’ implied that the motor cortex cared more about kinematics than kinetics, which would become the next big debate in motor neuroscience.</li>\n<li>Kinematics: descriptive features of motion that indicate the desired outcome of a movement, but not instructions for how to create them.</li>\n<li>This shifts the role of the motor cortex up the hierarchy as kinematics is further removed from the level of muscle compared to kinetics.</li>\n<li>Georgopoulos became an adamant defender of the kinematics perspective of the motor cortex in the decades to come.</li>\n<li>Using the direction tuning from multiple neurons, Georgopoulos calculated a ‘population vector’ that points in the direction of movement that the neural population encodes.</li>\n<li>Population vector: a weighted average of all direction tuned neurons where the weight is how strong that direction-neuron is firing.</li>\n<li>By calculating the population vector, Georgopoulos could accurately read out the direction an animal’s arm was moving.</li>\n<li>However, several later studies showed how other information could be determined from the population, thereby weakening Georgopoulos’s theory that kinematics is special.</li>\n<li>Perhaps there is no single value that neurons in the motor cortex code for;

Cajal noticed that cells were always arranged in a certain way, as the dendrites of a cell would face the direction the signal was coming from and the axon went towards the brain.</li>\n<li>This pattern strongly suggested that signals flow from dendrites to axons.</li>\n<li>Structure exists at many scales in the brain.</li>\n<li>Graph theory offers a way to talk about neural networks that abstract away from the many biological details.</li>\n<li>Review of graphs, which are composed of nodes and edges.</li>\n<li>Nodes are the base unit of the graph and edges represent connections between them.</li>\n<li>The strength of graph theory comes from stripping away details to find the common underlying structure.</li>\n<li>The structure of the brain maps well onto a graph as neurons are nodes and the connections between neurons are edges.</li>\n<li>To understand how structure results in function, we first need the ability to describe structure.</li>\n<li>Graph theory provides a language to describe structure.</li>\n<li>Review of small world networks (graphs with short average path lengths).</li>\n<li>One way to achieve a small world network is to have all nodes heavily interconnected. Another way is to cluster the nodes and have sparse connections between them.</li>\n<li>The brain was found to be a small world network with high clustering and long-distance connections.</li>\n<li>The biggest reason for the small world network may be energy costs. A small world network is efficient because it doesn’t require many neurons to achieve a short average path length.</li>\n<li>Connectome: a graph describing the connections in a brain.</li>\n<li>The lack of connectomic data is mostly due to the gruelling process to collect it.</li>\n<li>Hub: nodes that are highly connected and have a high degree.</li>\n<li>The human brain has hubs sprinkled throughout.</li>\n<li>E.g. The cingulate and precuneus are hubs, while the visual cortex and auditory cortex aren’t.</li>\n<li>Hub regions are complex because they gather information from multiple sources and distribute it out far.</li>\n<li>The development of hub neurons suggests their importance as they’re often the first neurons to be born.</li>\n<li>Review of Danielle Bassett’s work on network neuroscience and brain dysfunction.</li>\n<li>An adult brain has far fewer neurons than when it was in the womb as half of the neurons produced during development die.</li>\n<li>The number of connections made by a cortical neuron peaks around the first year of life and reduces by the third year.</li>\n<li>The brain is thus built by a surge and retreat of neurons and connections.</li>\n<li>During development, the pruning of neurons and synapses is ruthless; only the useful survive.</li>\n<li>E.g. Synapses are built to carry signals between neurons and if no signal flows, the synapse must go.</li>\n<li>It’s analogous to letting a bush grow for the purpose of carving art out of it.</li>\n<li>This approach of overbuilding capacity and then trimming the fat runs counter to how a graph theorist might approach building a network.</li>\n<li>E.g. A public transit designer wouldn’t build a bunch of train stations and bus stops and remove the unused stops. Instead, the designer would build from the bottom up by carefully adding stops as needed. The network gets more efficient by adding well-placed edges and nodes.</li>\n<li>The brain, in contrast, doesn’t have a designer which explains why the brain needs to overproduce and prune.</li>\n<li>The only way the brain can make decisions about which connections should exist is by calculating the activity that passes through those connections.</li>\n<li>If the connection doesn’t exist, the activity on it can’t be measured.</li>\n<li>A decreased pruning rate, as seen in the brain, enables the brain to quickly eliminate useless connections while still allowing the network enough time to fine-tune the remaining structure.</li>\n<li>E.g. Like a marble sculptor, the gross details are quickly cut out and the fine details are slowly cut out.</li>\n<li>Review of Eve Marder work on the lobster ganglion circuit for digestion.</li>\n<li>Neuromodulators: chemicals that fiddle with the settings of a neural circuit.</li>\n<li>The massive effort to get a connectome depends on the assumption that the structure-function relationship is true. However, neuromodulators can change a network’s function without affecting its structure.</li>\n<li>If neuromodulators can release the activity of neurons in a circuit from the strict constraints of their architecture, then structure isn’t destiny.</li>\n<li>Another important finding from Marder’s work is that different structures can produce the same behaviors.</li>\n<li>E.g. By simulating as many as 20 million possible ganglion circuits, Marder’s lab found that the vast majority aren’t capable of producing the desired rhythms, but certain configurations are.</li>\n<li>The important point is that diversity doesn’t always mean difference, so diverse structures could create the same function, adding another wrinkle to the structure-function relationship.</li>\n<li>However, Marder’s work also highlights the need for the connectome as her work was built atop it.</li>\n<li>Without the detailed structural information, there’s no structure-function relationship to be explored.</li>\n<li>“No circuit can be fully understood without a connectivity diagram. A connectivity diagram is only a necessary beginning, but not in itself, an answer.” - Eve Marder</li>\n<li>Knowing the structure of the nervous system is necessary but not sufficient.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-10-making-rational-decisions\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-10-making-rational-decisions\" aria-label=\"chapter 10 making rational decisions permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 10: Making Rational Decisions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Review of Hermann von Helmholtz’s work on trichromatic theory.</li>\n<li>Helmholtz concluded that a large amount of processing must go on between when sensory information comes in and when it becomes a conscious experience.</li>\n<li>Unconscious inference: how real objects are inferred by their effect on the sense organs.</li>\n<li>He proposed that unconscious inference proceeded by interpreting the current sensory input in the context of pre-existing knowledge about the world.</li>\n<li>Review of chance, probability, conditional probability, inverse probability, and Bayes’ rule.</li>\n<li>To determine the cause of any effect, one must first know the likely effects of each cause.</li>\n<li>John Anderson formally debuted a Bayesian approach to psychology called ‘rational analysis’.</li>\n<li>E.g. The probability of a memory being useful in a particular situation is found by combining: how likely you find yourself in that situation if that memory were useful, and a prior that assumes newer memories are more likely useful.</li>\n<li>If we find ourselves in a world that deviates from the one we’ve evolved and developed in, our priors can be misleading.</li>\n<li>E.g. The phrase ‘when you hear hooves, think of horses and not zebras’ is only good advice in a world with more horses than zebras.</li>\n<li>Incoming sensory information combines with a rich set of background knowledge before perception is complete.</li>\n<li>Just as a rumor transforms into a fact as you hear it from many different people, in Bayes’ rule, getting the same information from multiple senses strengthens the belief in that information.</li>\n<li>As with rumors, the reliability of the sensory information source also matter.</li>\n<li>E.g. The vestibular organs are more reliable than vision for balance.</li>\n<li>Bayes’ rule naturally balances how much to rely on a source based on how reliable it is.</li>\n<li>For the most part, humans behave as good Bayesians.</li>\n<li>Not all psychologists believe that the brain is Bayesian though.</li>\n<li>To some, a theory that explains everything is at risk of explaining nothing.</li>\n<li>Another issue with Bayesian models is that they have too many free parameters, meaning any model can fit any data.</li>\n<li>A model that can fit anything can never be wrong.</li>\n<li>Then there are issues with priors.</li>\n<li>E.g. If one model assumes the prior that motion is slow, while another model assumes the prior that motion is fast, which one is true?</li>\n<li>E.g. Where do priors come from?</li>\n<li>Lastly, how is Bayes’ rule implemented in the brain?

And does the brain try to reduce their firing?</li>\n<li>The evidence for predictive coding is mixed as not all studies find error neurons and even when they do, these neurons don’t always behave as predicted by the predictive coding hypothesis.</li>\n<li>Another way of minimizing free energy, of minimizing the difference between the brain’s prediction and experience, is to control experience.</li>\n<li>Organisms can choose actions that result in predictable sensory experiences.</li>\n<li>E.g.

If you imagine putting your finger on a coffee cup and moving your finger, the grid cells in the finger brain region track the location of your fingertip.</li>\n<li>By combining information about where the finger is and what the cup feels like right there, the cortical column can learn the shape of the object as it’s explored.</li>\n<li>As cortical columns exist throughout the neocortex, this process could be happening in parallel everywhere, hence the thousands brains in the Thousand Brains Theory.</li>\n<li>If this process applies to physical space, Hawkins argues that they can also be applied to abstract space.</li>\n<li>E.g. The space of thought or language.</li>\n<li>However, some studies find that the size of columns, the number and type of neurons they have, and how they interact with each other, varies across the neocortex.</li>\n<li>If these columns are not as uniform and identical as the Thousand Brains Theory assumes, the hope for a universal algorithm of intelligence may be in vain.</li>\n<li>Mathematical models of the brain are usually built by first selecting a collection of facts that seem relevant, and then these facts are simplified and pieced together in a theory of how a bit of the brain could work.</li>\n<li>No theory of the brain is complete without explaining its biggest and most enduring mystery: consciousness.</li>\n<li>Review of integrated information theory (IIT).</li>\n<li>IIT is designed to measure consciousness in anything and the end result is a unified measure of ‘integrated information’ called phi.</li>\n<li>Phi indicates just how intermixed the information in a system is and the higher it is, the more conscious a system is.</li>\n<li>Calculating phi for an reasonably complex system is near impossible.</li>\n<li>GUTs are difficult, in part, because they must make simple and universal claims about an incredibly complex object.</li>\n<li>Almost any statement about the brain is guaranteed to have exceptions.</li>\n<li>The conundrum of GUTs are that if they’re too grand, they won’t explain specific data.
