Thus, by delaying myelination, we are better learners at a younger age but less efficient.</li>\n<li>This culture-gene coevolution creates an autocatalytic process such that no matter how big our brains get, there will always be much more cultural information than we can learn in a lifetime.</li>\n<li>The better our brains get at cultural learning, the faster adaptive cultural information accumulates, and the greater the pressure on brains to acquire and store this information.</li>\n<li>This also explains why babies are nearly helpless at birth because they’re evolved to learn cultural information instead of surviving.</li>\n<li>Food processing externalize digestion.</li>\n<li>Compare to other primates, humans have unusual digestive systems and we lack a substantial amount of digestive power.</li>\n<li>The answer is that our digestive systems have coevolved with culturally transmitted knowledge related to food processing.</li>\n<li>Cooking is probably the most important piece of food processing knowledge as it’s shaped our digestive system the most.</li>\n<li>While all this food processing reduces the digestive effort of our mouth, stomach, and colon, it doesn’t change the need to actually absorb the nutrients, which is why our small intestines are the right size for a primate of our build.</li>\n<li>What’s been underemphasized is that cooking isn’t something we do instinctively, but is a product of cultural evolution.</li>\n<li>The energy savings from the externalization of digestive functions by cultural evolution became one part in a set of adjustments that allowed our species to build, maintain, and use larger brains.</li>\n<li>Effective molars and weapons can replace big teeth and strong muscles.</li>\n<li>While natural selection traded strength for fat, another key change was that the human neocortex sends neural connections deeper into motor neurons, spinal cord, and brainstem than in other mammals.</li>\n<li>It’s this depth of connections that enables our fine dexterity.</li>\n<li>E.g. Hands, tongues, vocal cords, and jaws.</li>\n<li>With the exception of domesticated horses, which we’ve artificially selected for endurance, our main competition comes from African wild dogs, wolves, and hyenas.</li>\n<li>However, even our competition loses in warmer temperatures and chimpanzees aren’t even in our league.</li>\n<li>Our specialized distance running adaptations\n<ul>\n<li>Our feet have springy arches that store energy and absorb the shock of repeated impacts as long as we don’t land on our heels.</li>\n<li>Longer legs with extended tendons.</li>\n<li>We have more slow-twitch fibers yielding much greater aerobic capacity.</li>\n<li>Reinforced lower body joints.</li>\n<li>Enlarged gluteus maximus or butt.</li>\n<li>Arm swinging balances us while running.</li>\n<li>Shock-absorbing ligaments connecting our heads and shoulders secures and balances our skulls and brains against running shocks.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The most impressive adaptation is our thermoregulatory adaptations as we’re the sweatiest species.</li>\n<li>Since running heats up animals, the inability of most mammals to run long distances is due to the inability to manage this heat buildup.</li>\n<li>Our heat management adaptations\n<ul>\n<li>Near complete loss of hair.</li>\n<li>Many sweat glands.</li>\n<li>Emergence of a head-cooling system.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>No other animal can sweat faster than we do, and thus no other animal can remove heat as fast as we do.</li>\n<li>This system can run and keep us running for many hours, provided it doesn’t run short of water.</li>\n<li>So where’s the genetically evolved water storage system or tanks?</li>\n<li>In contrast to us, horses, which can compete with us for distance, do have the ability to store large amounts of water.</li>\n<li>The answer is that cultural evolution supplied water containers and water-finding knowledge.</li>\n<li>This suggests that the evolution of our fancy sweat-based thermoregulatory system could only happen after cultural evolution generated the knowledge for making water containers and finding water sources.</li>\n<li>However, there’s more to persistence hunting than just endurance.</li>\n<li>We also need to track the prey for several hours as the prey could go back into their group.</li>\n<li>So hunters must be able to track and identify individuals.</li>\n<li>This knowledge is cultural transmitted and must be learned from skilled hunters.</li>\n<li>Another culturally transmitted trick is that hunters can strategically vary their speed to force their prey to run inefficiently.</li>\n<li>This is due to a body-design limitation that applies to quadrupeds but not to bipeds.</li>\n<li>The result is that hunters force their prey into a series of sprints and rests that eventually causes heat stroke.</li>\n<li>Even running isn’t natural for us and is copied from skilled hunters.</li>\n<li>We have an impressive folkbiological cognitive system for dealing with information about plants and animals.</li>\n<li>An object “is” what “it” does. The function defines the concept.</li>\n<li>E.g. A painted cat is still a cat, but a disassembled table made into a chair isn’t a table.</li>\n<li>This system organizes the vast body of information that a person picks up through cultural transmission and individual experience.</li>\n<li>This has interesting implications as infants seem to avoid playing with plants but don’t show the same concern for other objects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-6-why-some-people-have-blue-eyes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-6-why-some-people-have-blue-eyes\" aria-label=\"chapter 6 why some people have blue eyes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 6: Why Some People Have Blue Eyes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Blue and green eyes are a side effect of natural selection favoring genes for lighter skin in populations living at high latitudes.</li>\n<li>If cultural evolution hadn’t produced agriculture, then there would be no blue or green eyes.</li>\n<li>Thus, cultural evolution can shape our environment and result in changes in genetic evolution.</li>\n<li>Review of rice wine, the ADH1B gene, and lactose tolerance.</li>\n<li>Cheese and yogurt are, in part, cultural adaptations for reducing lactose in dairy, which allows everyone to get the nutrients from milk but without the side-effects of lactose intolerance.</li>\n<li>Natural selection found different ways to create lactase persistence in different populations.</li>\n<li>These three cases of culture-driven genetic evolution are the best understood cases that we have of this type of evolution, but there may be more.</li>\n<li>Are these cases outliers or unique somehow?</li>\n<li>Maybe they’re outliers, it’s hard to say because maybe the agricultural revolution is just in the sweet spot for today’s science.</li>\n<li>We don’t have data for older or recent revolutions and how they affect our genome.</li>\n<li>Cultural evolution can, has, and is powerfully shaping the human genome in a variety of important ways.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-7-on-the-origin-of-faith\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-7-on-the-origin-of-faith\" aria-label=\"chapter 7 on the origin of faith permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 7: On the Origin of Faith</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The causal opacity of many cultural adaptations had a big impact on our psychology.</li>\n<li>Causal opacity: when a person can’t readily infer the function, relationship, or importance of a cultural adaptation.</li>\n<li>E.g.

Larger groups generate more lucky errors, new combinations, and intentional improvements.</li>\n<li>Bigger groups have the potential for more rapid cumulative cultural evolution as their rate of emergence depends on the slowest element.</li>\n<li>All of this assumes that the members of such group are sufficiently interconnected so that ideas and improvements spread rapidly.</li>\n<li>E.g. Imagine that every person keeps any insights to themselves, then each improvement and innovation dies with them and no fancy tools emerge. This is the case for most animals.</li>\n<li>Group size and degree of social interconnectedness are key to cumulative cultural evolution.</li>\n<li>E.g. Suppose we have two groups: the Geniuses and the Butterflies. The Geniuses devise an invention once in 10 lifetimes while the Butterflies only devise the same invention once in 1000 lifetimes. So, this means that the Geniuses are 100 times smarter than the Butterflies. However, the Geniuses aren’t very social and only have 1 friend they can learn from, while the Butterflies have 10 friends, making them 10 times more social. Now, everyone in both populations tries to obtain an invention by either figuring it out themselves or by learning from friends. Suppose learning from friends is difficult and that the learner only learns it half the time. After everyone has done their own learning and tried to learn from their friends, do you think the innovation will be more common among the Geniuses or the Butterflies? Among the Geniuses, about 18% will end up with the invention while 99.99% of the Butterflies will have the innovation.</li>\n<li>The takeaway: if you want to have cool technology, it’s better to be social than smart.</li>\n<li>Cultural evolution also shapes the learnability of knowledge and skills.</li>\n<li>E.g. Larger communities won’t just have more sophisticated tools and technologies, they’ll also have more learnable techniques for producing them.</li>\n<li>Social interconnectedness makes everyone more skilled over time.</li>\n<li>Importantly, learners can create innovations without inventions by combining good elements from previous models.</li>\n<li>This process is crucial for our understanding of innovation.</li>\n<li>Larger populations tend to have more complex technologies and a greater number of technologies.</li>\n<li>Two implications of collective brains\n<ul>\n<li>A population can lose adaptive cultural information if the group suddenly shrinks and gets socially disconnected.\n<ul>\n<li>This can be due to an epidemic, war, or the imperfect copying of others. Copies are usually worse than the originals.</li>\n<li>This is prevented if the copy turns out better than the original. Some students end up better than their teacher.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A population’s size and social interconnectedness sets a maximum on the size of a group’s collective brain.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Larger populations can overcome the inherent loss of information in cultural transmission because if more individuals try to learn something, there’s a better chance that someone ends up with knowledge or skills that are at least as good as, if not better than, their teachers.</li>\n<li>Interconnectedness is important because it increases the chances that an individual will access a skilled/successful model and thus the chances that they’ll exceed the model.</li>\n<li>The size and interconnectedness of our social groups depends on social norms and cultural technologies such as rituals.</li>\n<li>The point is that if intergroup competition favors sophisticated tools and technologies, it has to favor social norms and institutions that can sustain a large collective brain. Technology and culture have to coevolve.</li>\n<li>Cumulative culture is our thing; it’s what makes us special.</li>\n<li>Greater individual brainpower is dwarfed by greater social interconnectedness and longer lives.</li>\n<li>E.g. Neanderthals may have been individually smarter than us, but our greater social interconnectedness and longer lives resulted in a greater advantage.</li>\n<li>Intelligence depends on both genetic and cultural evolution.</li>\n<li>It’s more important for a cultural species to be social than to be innately smart in producing complex technologies.</li>\n<li>Collective brains allow us to solve problems that we individually couldn’t have.</li>\n<li>In the long run, our world, filled with complex concepts, tools, and procedures, will favor genes for more sophisticated cognitive abilities.</li>\n<li>Even if our genes were fixed, cultural evolution would still make us smarter.</li>\n<li>The ability to solve a problem depends on culture.</li>\n<li>Many of the products of cultural evolution give us not only ready concepts to apply to new problems and concepts to recombine, but they also give us new cognitive tools and mental abilities.</li>\n<li>E.g.

Being on the ground provides advantages such as freeing both hands, providing greater access to resources, and making it easier to see and learn from others.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Predation favors larger groups, which favor greater cultural accumulations\n<ul>\n<li>Mammals often respond to increased predation by forming larger groups.</li>\n<li>There’s safety in numbers.</li>\n<li>Larger groups might have caused an increase in the size and complexity of tools, skills, and knowledge, resulting in more innovations and ideas.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Natural selection pushes brain size up to increase individual fitness but the risk is that this makes the specie more vulnerable to extinction from shocks.</li>\n<li>To work around this, moms can rely on others for help raising her child.</li>\n<li>The seeds of pair-bonding may begin to sprout when a group gets large.</li>\n<li>Pair-bonds allow individuals to transform a few scattered kin-based relationships into something more like a family or kin-network.</li>\n<li>Knowing such a network allows individuals more opportunities for social learning.</li>\n<li>This also means that relatives and family members can help mom raise her child.</li>\n<li>E.g. Human mothers only do 50% of the child care compared to 100% for ape mothers.</li>\n<li>Being both ground-based and predators will increase the size of groups’ cultural knowledge and may push a species past the threshold.</li>\n<li>However, expanding brains to store more cultural information still faces the obstacle that mothers have to invest a lot into their offspring.</li>\n<li>To push through this obstacle, larger group sizes can lead to pair-bonding and kinship circle, increasing social learning opportunities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-17-a-new-kind-of-animal\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-17-a-new-kind-of-animal\" aria-label=\"chapter 17 a new kind of animal permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 17: A New Kind of Animal</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The wrong way to understand humans is to think that we’re just a really smart and less hairy chimpanzee.</li>\n<li>We are a new kind of animal; a major transition.</li>\n<li>We shouldn’t think of culture as some addition to genetic evolution; culture is one of the central forces of our evolution and our success.</li>\n<li>Many features of our anatomy only make sense as genetically evolved responses to selective pressures created by cultural evolution.</li>\n<li>E.g.
