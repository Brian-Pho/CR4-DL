Airlines create a lot of value but don’t capture much of it (they have low profit margins). In contrast, Google creates less value but captures far more.</li>\n<li>The difference lies in their competitors, airlines exist in a ‘perfect competition’ while Google exists as a ‘monopoly’.</li>\n<li>Under perfect competition, in the long run no company makes an economic profit.</li>\n<li>Under monopoly, a company can set its own prices and thus maximizes its profits.</li>\n<li>Monopoly: the kind of company that’s so good at what it does that no other firm can offer a close substitute.</li>\n<li>The lesson for entrepreneurs is clear: if you want to create and capture lasting value, don’t build an non-unique commodity business, build a monopoly.</li>\n<li>Our perception of firms is that they’re similar on the spectrum of perfect competition to monopoly, but the reality is that firms are much closer to one extreme.</li>\n<li>This is due, in part, because monopolists lie to protect themselves.</li>\n<li>E.g. Lying about the power of their nonexistent competition or framing itself as just another company.</li>\n<li>On the other side of the spectrum, non-monopolists exaggerate their distinction by arguing that they’re unique.</li>\n<li>E.g. Non-monopolists define their market as the intersection of various smaller markets, while monopolists define their market as the union of several large markets.</li>\n<li>A competitive ecosystem pushes people to ruthlessness or death.</li>\n<li>A monopoly is successful enough to care for it’s employees and care about ethics.</li>\n<li>Only one thing can allow a business to transcend the daily struggle for survival: monopoly profits.</li>\n<li>A monopoly is great for the company, but bad for everyone else as profits come at the expense of the rest of society.</li>\n<li>Monopolies deserve their bad reputation, but only in a static world where they just take money without using it.</li>\n<li>But in a dynamic world like ours, creative monopolies use their profits to innovate.</li>\n<li>Even the government knows this, which is why it grants patents or a monopoly to produce a specific invention.</li>\n<li>If the tendency of monopoly businesses were to hold back progress, they’d be dangerous and we’d be right to oppose them, but history tells us that old monopolies get replaced by new and innovative monopolies.</li>\n<li>Monopolies drive progress because the promise and guarantee of years, or even decades, of profits provides a powerful incentive to innovate.</li>\n<li>Profits enable a company to make long-term plans and to finance ambitious research projects that firms locked in competition can’t dream of.</li>\n<li>Why then are economists obsessed with competition as the ideal state? It’s a relic of history.</li>\n<li>Monopoly is the condition of every successful business.</li>\n<li>All happy companies are different as each is a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same as they failed to escape competition.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-4-the-ideology-of-competition\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-4-the-ideology-of-competition\" aria-label=\"chapter 4 the ideology of competition permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 4: The Ideology of Competition</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>No notes on the author’s opinion on competition, which isn’t favorable.</li>\n<li>Winning is better than losing, but everybody loses when the war isn’t one worth fighting.</li>\n<li>If you can’t beat a rival, it may be better to merge.</li>\n<li>Sometimes you do have to fight and when that happens, you fight to win and to win quickly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-5-last-mover-advantage\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-5-last-mover-advantage\" aria-label=\"chapter 5 last mover advantage permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 5: Last Mover Advantage</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Escaping competition will give you a monopoly, but even a monopoly will fail unless it can innovate.</li>\n<li>A great business is defined by its ability to generate cash flows in the future.</li>\n<li>E.g. The value of a business today is the sum of all money it will make in the future, discounted for future value though as money today is worth more than the same amount in the future.</li>\n<li>Most of a tech company’s value comes at least 10 to 15 years into the future.</li>\n<li>For a company to be valuable, it must grow and endure, but it’s difficult to measure the durability of a company in contrast to growth.</li>\n<li>Will this business still be around a decade from now?</li>\n<li>Common monopoly characteristics\n<ul>\n<li>Proprietary technology\n<ul>\n<li>The most substantive advantage a company can have because it’s difficult to replicate.</li>\n<li>As a rule of thumb, proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its closest substitute.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Network effects\n<ul>\n<li>A product that becomes more useful as more people use it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Economies of scale\n<ul>\n<li>A monopoly gets stronger as it gets bigger.</li>\n<li>Certain businesses gain more advantages as they grow.</li>\n<li>E.g. A yoga studio is difficult to scale compared to software.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Branding\n<ul>\n<li>Creating a strong brand is a powerful way to claim a monopoly.</li>\n<li>A strong brand depends on a strong underlying substance.</li>\n<li>E.g. Apple has proprietary technologies, manufactures at scale, and enjoys strong network effects due to its ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Beginning with brand rather than substance is dangerous.</li>\n<li>E.g. Yahoo!</li>\n<li>No technology company can be built on branding alone, it must first have a great product.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Building a monopoly\n<ul>\n<li>Start small and monopolize\n<ul>\n<li>Err on the side of starting too small because it’s easier to dominate a small market than a large one.</li>\n<li>The perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people concentrated together and served by no or few competitors.</li>\n<li>A large market will either lack a good starting point or will be open to competition.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Scaling up\n<ul>\n<li>Once you’ve created and dominated a niche market, you should then gradually expand into related and slightly broader markets.</li>\n<li>E.g.
