Chess, firefighting, and naval commanders.</li>\n<li>However, work by Daniel Kahneman has shown the opposite, that experience develops confidence but not skill.</li>\n<li>One literature review showed that experience simply didn’t create skill in a wide range of real-world scenarios.</li>\n<li>E.g. College administrators assessing student potential, psychiatrists predicting patient performance, and HR professionals predicting job candidates.</li>\n<li>In these domains where human behaviour is involved and where patterns don’t repeat, repetition and experience didn’t cause learning.</li>\n<li>Chess, golf, and firefighting are exceptions because they’re fields with well defined goals and quantitative performance, but they aren’t the rule.</li>\n<li>Do specialists get better with experience or not?</li>\n<li>Whether experience inevitably leads to expertise depends entirely on the domain in question.</li>\n<li>Certain domains where instinctive pattern recognition works powerfully are called “kind” learning environments.</li>\n<li>In kind environments, patterns repeat over and over, feedback is extremely accurate and fast, the rules and limits stay constant, and performance is easily measured.</li>\n<li>Deliberate practice does extremely well in kind environments.</li>\n<li>However, not all environments are kind, the rest are called “wicked” domains.</li>\n<li>In wicked environments, the rules of the game are often unclear or incomplete, there may or may not be repetitive patterns that are obvious, and feedback is often delayed, inaccurate, or both.</li>\n<li>In the most devilishly wicked learning environments, experience will reinforce the wrong lessons.</li>\n<li>E.g. A physician physically examining a patient and getting the correct diagnosis only because the physician is spreading said diagnosis through physical examination.</li>\n<li>If the rules of the game change, experience becomes less valuable.</li>\n<li>E.g. How elders in a community provide less valuable information if the world changes to quickly because the knowledge they have isn’t relevant for the current world.</li>\n<li>Moravec’s paradox: that machines and humans frequently have opposite strengths and weaknesses.</li>\n<li>In chess, computers are very good at tactics (short-term actions) but lack in strategy (long-term planning). Humans are the opposite.</li>\n<li>By combining both humans and computers, we get the best tactics and strategy.</li>\n<li>If chess experts are given a chess board with pieces to memorize and recreate, the level of expertise matches the accuracy of the recreation.</li>\n<li>E.g. Grandmasters could accurately recreate the entire board, masters a little less so, amateurs almost not at all.</li>\n<li>However, if the chess pieces are place in a configuration that would never actually occur in a game, suddenly the experts perform as well as the amateur players.</li>\n<li>Instead of remembering the position of every piece, experts use chunking to group familiar patterns thus enabling them to recreate the board more accurately.</li>\n<li>Chunking helps explain instances of apparently miraculous, domain-specific memory.</li>\n<li>E.g. Musicians playing long pieces by heart, quarterbacks recognizing where to throw in a split second, and the superhuman reflexes of elite athletes.</li>\n<li>We all intuitively chunk words into sentences.</li>\n<li>Chunking can seem like magic but it comes from extensive, deliberate practice.</li>\n<li>This results in islands of genius where certain skills in experts are extraordinary but other skills are average or below average.</li>\n<li>Patterns and familiar structures were critical to the savant’s extraordinary recall ability or any expert.</li>\n<li>The bigger the picture and the more complex it is, the more unique the potential human contribution.</li>\n<li>Our greatest strength is the exact opposite of narrow specialization. It’s our ability to integrate and to generalize.</li>\n<li>When a domain has rules and answers that are stable over time, like chess, golf, and music, an argument can be made for savant-like hyperspecialized practice from day one.</li>\n<li>But not everything, and most domains, aren’t stable and have answers.</li>\n<li>E.g. Scientific research, business, and hospitals.</li>\n<li>We’ve been using the wrong stories to teach success. The Tiger and Polgar stories give the false impression that human skill is always developed in an extremely kind learning environment.</li>\n<li>If the amount of early, specialized practice in a narrow area was key to performance, then savant and child prodigies would dominate every domain.</li>\n<li>However no savant has ever been known to become a significant creator who changed their field.</li>\n<li>When the rules of a domain are altered slightly, it makes experts appear to have traded flexibility for narrow skill.</li>\n<li>E.g. If the rules of chess are changed, then expert chess players do as well as or worse than amateurs.</li>\n<li>Experts perform worse than novices when the rules change, a phenomenon called cognitive entrenchment, because it’s difficult for experts to unlearn their previous knowledge.</li>\n<li>One solution is to vary challenges within a domain drastically or to always have one foot outside your world.</li>\n<li>E.g. Compared to other scientists, Nobel laureates are at least 22 times more likely to partake as an amateur in a nonscientific field.</li>\n<li>Rather than obsessively focusing on a narrow topic, creative achievers tend to have broad interests.</li>\n<li>“This breadth often supports insights that can’t be attributed to domain-specific expertise alone.” - Dean Simonton</li>\n<li>E.g. Steve Jobs combined calligraphy class with design aesthetics. Claude Shannon combined philosophy logic with telephone call-routing technology.</li>\n<li>“It just happened that no one else was familiar with both of those fields at the same time.” - Claude Shannon</li>\n<li>The successful adapters were excellent at taking knowledge from one pursuit and applying it creatively to another, avoiding cognitive entrenchment.</li>\n<li>The skill is to avoid the same old patterns by breaking them with outside experiences and analogies.</li>\n<li>In the wicked world, range is an advantage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-2-how-the-wicked-world-was-made\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-2-how-the-wicked-world-was-made\" aria-label=\"chapter 2 how the wicked world was made permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 2: How the Wicked World Was Made</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Flynn effect: the increase in IQ score with each new generation.</li>\n<li>Premodern people miss the forest for the trees; modern people miss the trees for the forest.</li>\n<li>The more modern people become, the more powerful their abstract thinking and the less they rely on concrete experience.</li>\n<li>E.g.
