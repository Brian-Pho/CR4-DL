When a person tilts their head forwards, there’s a tingling sensation at the front of their tongue similar to champagne bubbles. When tilted backwards, there’s a tingling at the back of the tongue.</li>\n<li>When the author tested out the device with his eyes closed, he soon forgot that the sensory information was coming from his tongue.</li>\n<li>When C.S. tried the device for the first time, she started to cry. The sense of perpetual falling that she’s felt for five years is finally gone.</li>\n<li>With the device, C.S. looks peaceful. The jerking has stopped, the mysterious demons that seemed to be inside her, pushing her off balance, have disappeared.</li>\n<li>Her first goal is to stand upright without support for twenty minutes, which she eventually achieved.</li>\n<li>In her brain, she’s decoding the signals from the artificial vestibular apparatus. This is only possible due to neuroplasticity since the signals that normally make their way to the brain’s sensory cortex are now redirected to the area that processes balance.</li>\n<li>However, the second neuroplastic marvel appears after the device is removed.</li>\n<li>Without the device, C.S. can stand without falling and hugs the researchers.</li>\n<li>E.g. “I feel anchored and solid. I don’t have to think where my muscles are. I can actually think of other things.” - C.S.</li>\n<li>The interesting and remarkable finding is that without the device, C.S. has no artificial and no natural vestibular apparatus, so how is she able to balance?</li>\n<li>The first time C.S. wore the device, it was only for a minute. However, the researchers noticed a residual effect after removing the device where C.S. could maintain balance for about twenty seconds.</li>\n<li>For the second time, C.S. had the device on for two minutes and the residual effect lasted for about forty seconds.</li>\n<li>The third time she had the device on was for twenty minutes, expecting a residual effect of around seven minutes following the pattern of the previous experiments. However, the effect lasted an hour.</li>\n<li>Something amazing was happening here for the residual effect to occur and to persist, sometimes even longer than the training period.</li>\n<li>Furthermore, C.S. behaves almost normally now and the link between the visual and vestibular system is also recovered as she can track moving targets.</li>\n<li>Possible explanations for the residual effect\n<ul>\n<li>The artificial vestibular device may help to recalibrate and reinforce the disorganized and noisy signals from her damaged vestibular system.</li>\n<li>The device might also recruit other pathways using neuroplasticity. It might unmask unused or older pathways, making them more efficient by shortening them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How far can the residual effect be pushed? Is there a limit where the residual time never grows longer?</li>\n<li>Over the next year, C.S. wore the device more often to get relief and to build up her residual effect.</li>\n<li>Her residual effect progressed from multiple hours, to days, and then to four months.</li>\n<li>And now, she doesn’t use the device at all and may be cured of her condition.</li>\n<li>A similar sensory substitution device was built for congenitally blind people where a camera and computer translated light signals into vibration signals felt in the person’s back.</li>\n<li>The stimulators acted like pixels, vibrating for darker shades and freezing for lighter shades.</li>\n<li>This tactile-vision device enabled blind subjects to read, make out faces, and distinguish objects.</li>\n<li>This suggests that the blind subjects experienced the space in front of the camera as 3D and not as skin stimuli.</li>\n<li>Their mental perceptual experience took place not on the skin’s surface but in the world.</li>\n<li>E.g. If tickled near the stimulators, the subjects didn’t confuse the tickle with a visual stimulus.</li>\n<li>The idea that our brain structure is fixed and hardwired by genetics is called “localizationism”.</li>\n<li>Paul Bach-y-Rita rejected the claims made by localizationism and argued that our senses have an unexpected plastic nature to them where damage to one sensory system can be compensated for by another sense.</li>\n<li>“We see with our brains, not with our eyes” - Paul Bach-y-Rita</li>\n<li>This claim goes against our intuitive belief that we see with our eyes.</li>\n<li>How a sensation enters the brain isn’t important.</li>\n<li>Review of the discovery of Broca’s and Wernicke’s area.</li>\n<li>Sensory substitution is possible because all of our sense receptors translate different kinds of energy from the external world into the common language of electrical patterns.</li>\n<li>The tongue is the ideal brain-machine interface because it has no insensitive layer of dead skin.</li>\n<li>Paul’s journey of learning about neuroplasticity started with his father who had a massive stroke that damaged major parts of his brain and brainstem, leaving him paralyzed.</li>\n<li>However, Paul’s father was able to recover most of his mobility and autopsy analysis showed that the damaged was extensive. This suggests that the brain can reorganize itself to recover functions after devastating strokes.</li>\n<li>One of the most amazing plasticity experiments of our time was done by Mriganka Sur, a neuroscientist who surgically rewired the optic nerves from a ferret’s visual cortex to their auditory cortex and discovered that the ferret learned to see.</li>\n<li>This is evidence that the auditory cortex can change to handle visual information.</li>\n<li>Implicit in Paul Bach-y-Rita’s work is the idea that we’re all born with a brain that’s more adaptable and opportunistic than we’ve believed.</li>\n<li>The brain survives in a changing world by changing itself.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-2-building-herself-a-better-brain\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-2-building-herself-a-better-brain\" aria-label=\"chapter 2 building herself a better brain permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 2: Building Herself a Better Brain</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We start with the case of B.A., a woman who’s body is asymmetrical.</li>\n<li>E.g.

Trouble pronouncing words, impaired spatial reasoning, and constantly losing her possessions.</li>\n<li>In graduate school, B.A. came across neuropsychologist Aleksandr Luria’s work.</li>\n<li>Luria observed and documented the case of Lyova Zazetsky, a man with symptoms similar to B.A. after a gunshot wound to his head.</li>\n<li>The wound was at the junction of the temporal, occipital, and parietal lobe.</li>\n<li>Luria realized that Zazetsky couldn’t relate and integrate different units into wholes.</li>\n<li>E.g. Relating symbols to meaning or the size of objects to each other.</li>\n<li>Around this time, B.A. came across a paper by Mark Rosenzweig that showed rat brain’s in a stimulating vs impoverished environment had more neurotransmitters, were heavier, and had better blood supply than those from the impoverished environment.</li>\n<li>Also around this time, B.A. came across a paper by Mark Rosenzweig showing how rats raised in stimulating environments had heavier brains with more neurotransmitters, and had better blood supply than those from impoverished environments.</li>\n<li>This evidence shows how neuroplasticity could produce changes in the structure of the brain.</li>\n<li>B.A.’s breakthrough was to link Luria’s and Rosenzweig’s research by creating a training program to work on her weakest function: relating symbols to each other.</li>\n<li>E.g.

The axon is a living cable.</li>\n<li>Merzenich discovered that cortical maps were dynamic by severing the peripheral nerves and seeing how the brain changed in response to input changes.</li>\n<li>Neuroscientists were willing to accept Hubel and Wiesel’s discovery that plasticity exists in infancy, but they rejected Merzenich’s discovery that plasticity continues into adulthood.</li>\n<li>Merzenich would go on to become a professor and research the auditory cortex, helping to invent the cochlear implant.</li>\n<li>In one of Merzenich’s experiments, he cut the nerve relaying sensory information from the middle of a monkey’s hand (median nerve) and saw that the cortical map for that area was invaded by the surrounding hand areas.</li>\n<li>This showed that if the median nerve was cut, other functioning nerves would take over the unused map space to process their input.</li>\n<li>Thus, brain maps are governed by an ongoing competition for brain area.</li>\n<li>Competitive plasticity in adults explains some of our limitations.</li>\n<li>E.g. It explains why it’s difficult for most adults to learn a second language and why it’s difficult to break bad habits.</li>\n<li>Plasticity doesn’t require nervous system damage but is a constant force.</li>\n<li>Our brain maps are constantly changing.</li>\n<li>It’s reasonable to assume that if new maps are forming, then new connections must also be forming between neurons.</li>\n<li>To explain the formation of new maps, Merzenich used Hebb’s learning rule to explain that simultaneous inputs become more strongly connected, thus forming a map.</li>\n<li>To test this hypothesis, Merzenich sewed together two monkey fingers and mapped their cortical representation. What he found was that simulation of either finger would light up a new single map because all movements and sensations in those fingers always occurred simultaneously, thus forming a map.</li>\n<li>This shows that the timing of inputs to neurons in the brain is key to forming cortical maps; neurons that fire together in time wired together to make a map.</li>\n<li>The reverse is also true: if you separate the signals to neurons in time, you create separate brain maps.</li>\n<li>E.g. Neurons that fire apart wire apart or neurons out of sync fail to link.</li>\n<li>In his final experiment, Merzenich grafted a small patch of skin from one finger, with its nerve, onto an adjacent finger.</li>\n<li>According to the anatomical-hardwiring model, the signals from that patch of skins should light up the map of the original finger. Instead, when the patch was stimulated, the map of its new finger lit up.</li>\n<li>Thus, the map for the patch of skin migrated from the brain map of the original finger to its new one, because both the patch and the new finger were simultaneously stimulated.</li>\n<li>A brain map is topographically organized if the map is ordered as the body itself is ordered.</li>\n<li>Topographic organization is efficient because brain areas that often work together are close together, reducing the distance signals need to travel.</li>\n<li>How does topographic organization emerge in a brain map?</li>\n<li>Like how a brain map forms, topographic organization emerges from the coincident timing of signals.</li>\n<li>E.g. Since thumb and pinkie finger signals tend to arrive at separate times, they have more distant brain maps.</li>\n<li>With training and learning, the area of maps can grow to represent more of that body part.</li>\n<li>E.g. Monkeys trained on a fine touch discrimination task using their index finger had an enlarged index finger representation in their brain.</li>\n<li>As brain maps grow, the neurons in the map become more efficient in two stages.</li>\n<li>The first stage is when the map grows to take up more space, using more neurons.</li>\n<li>The second stage is when the map uses fewer neurons to perform the task.</li>\n<li>E.g. When a child first learns to play the piano, they tend to use their entire upper body, such as wrist, arm, shoulder, to play each note. With practice, however, the pianist stops using irrelevant muscles and only uses the correct finger to play the note.</li>\n<li>This more efficient use of neurons happens whenever we become proficient at a skill and explains why we don’t quickly run out of map space as we practice or add skills to our repertoire.</li>\n<li>Neurons also become more sensitive as their receptive fields shrink, making the map more precise.</li>\n<li>Merzenich also discovered that paying close attention is essential for long-term plastic change as not paying attention did lead to changed brain maps, but that the changes didn’t last.</li>\n<li>No notes on Merzenich’s and Paula Tallal’s collaboration on children with delayed language development.</li>\n<li>Autism: a human mind that can’t conceive of other minds.</li>\n<li>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is crucial in reinforcing plasticity changes during the critical period in four different ways.</li>\n<li>When neurons fire together, they release BDNF which consolidates the connections between neurons and helps to wire them together so they fire together in the future.</li>\n<li>BDNF also promotes the growth of myelin sheathing that speeds up the transmission of electrical signals.</li>\n<li>During the critical period, BDNF turns on the nucleus basalis, which, together with the attention system, modulates plasticity in the brain.</li>\n<li>The final function of BDNF is to help terminate the critical period as once the main neuronal connections are stabilized, there’s less of a need for plasticity.</li>\n<li>No notes on how BDNF may explain all of the symptoms of autism.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-4-acquiring-tastes-and-loves\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-4-acquiring-tastes-and-loves\"

the ultimate sign of sexual plasticity is that sexuality, as an instinct, can be satisfied without accomplishing its biological goal: reproduction.</li>\n<li>As with sex, love is also flexible and its expression has changed throughout history.</li>\n<li>The brain structures that regulate instinctive behaviors, the hypothalamus and amygdala, are plastic, so it’s no surprised that the behaviors

If the sensory nerves in a monkey limb were cut, the monkey stopped using that limb. This seems strange because the motor nerves still functioned. One answer is that since movement is a reflex and a reflex is initiated by sensory information, losing sensory information means movement is impaired.</li>\n<li>However, another answer is that the monkey might not use their impaired limb because they could use their other good limb, thus compensating for the impairment.</li>\n<li>Taub experimented by cutting the sensory nerves in one of the monkey’s arms and put the other good arm in a sling, forcing the monkey to use the impaired arm.</li>\n<li>Would putting the good arm in a sling force the monkey to use the impaired arm?</li>\n<li>Yes, thus disproving the reflexological theory of movement.</li>\n<li>If we cut the sensory nerves in both arms, would the monkey use both arms?</li>\n<li>Yes, because the monkey has to survive.</li>\n<li>This finding is paradoxical because if one arm was impaired, the monkey wouldn’t use it. However, if both arms were impaired, then the monkey would use both.</li>\n<li>Even cutting all of the sensory inputs to the spinal cord resulted in monkeys using their limbs.</li>\n<li>Interestingly, if the impaired arm is put into a sling and then removed three months later, the monkey was able to use the impaired limb, suggesting that there’s a period of “learned nonuse” right after cutting the sensory nerves.</li>\n<li>Learned nonuse might be masking a patient’s ability to recover from stroke.</li>\n<li>By preventing stroke patients from using their good limb, Taub showed that 80 percent of stroke patients who had lost arm functionality can improve substantially with training of their weak arm. This method of therapy is called constraint-induced (CI) therapy.</li>\n<li>These improvement show that the brain is plastic and is capable of reorganization after damage.</li>\n<li>Constraint-induced therapy doesn’t work well with reinforcement learning because if the reward is only given after performing the task, the monkey wouldn’t use their impaired limb. Instead, behavior must be shaped by first rewarding small movements, and then rewarding progressively larger movements.</li>\n<li>After a stroke and disuse of a limb, movement is harder not only because of muscle atrophy but also because of brain atrophy.</li>\n<li>Brain scans of stroke patients show that the brain map for the affected limb shrinks by about half.</li>\n<li>After CI therapy, the size of the brain map returns to its original size.</li>\n<li>Currently, Taub is exploring the optimal length of CI therapy and results suggest that three hours a day with many movements is better than an exhausting six hours of treatment with fewer movements.</li>\n<li>Training principles\n<ul>\n<li>Training is more effective if the skill closely relates to everyday life</li>\n<li>Training should be done in increments</li>\n<li>Training should be concentrated</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Merzenich found that when the sensory input from a finger was cut off, the brain map associated with it typically changes in a 1 to 2 millimeter area of cortex.</li>\n<li>However, is this the limit of neuroplasticity?</li>\n<li>Further experiments revealed that neuroplastic change can occur up to 14 millimeters away, showing that the brain can massively rewire itself.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-6-brain-lock-unlocked\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-6-brain-lock-unlocked\" aria-label=\"chapter 6 brain lock unlocked permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 6: Brain Lock Unlocked</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Some people, the ones that excessively worry, are so constantly traumatized by their own brain that they often consider suicide.</li>\n<li>There are many kinds of worriers and many kinds of anxiety.</li>\n<li>E.g. Phobias, PTSD, panic attacks, and OCD.</li>\n<li>OCD often worsens over time, gradually altering the structure of the brain.</li>\n<li>The agony of the obsessive worrier is that whenever something bad is possible, it feels inevitable.</li>\n<li>After the obsessive worries begin, OCD patients typically do something to diminish the worry, a compulsive act.</li>\n<li>E.g. If they worry about germs, they’ll constantly wash themselves and disinfect their environment.</li>\n<li>E.g. In one case, a man feared being contaminated by the battery acid spilled in car accidents and would drive to the site of nearby accidents.

Having OCD patients relabel their problem not as germs or battery acid, but as OCD itself.</li>\n<li>One issue with current OCD treatments is that they also focus on the object of obsession, but the patient knows that they’re being obsessive. The problem is that they feel compelled to act on such obsessions.</li>\n<li>The second step is to refocus to another activity during an obsessive episode, thus weakening the link between the compulsion and the reward from reducing anxiety.</li>\n<li>Schwartz has had good results with severe cases and when he and his team scanned the brains of their improved patients, they found that the three “locked” parts of the brain had begun to fire separately.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-7-pain\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chapter-7-pain\" aria-label=\"chapter 7 pain permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chapter 7: Pain</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Review of V. S. Ramachandran’s work.</li>\n<li>Ramachandran hates crowds in science and doesn’t like large scientific meetings.</li>\n<li>He also has a disdain for complicated fancy equipment due to the time required to learn how to use it and that the conclusions drawn from such equipment are often too far removed from the brain.</li>\n<li>Review of phantom limb syndrome.</li>\n<li>Phantom limbs are a problem because they can result in chronic phantom pain in 95 percent of amputees, often for their lifetime.</li>\n<li>Phantom pain can also be due to amputation of the internal organs.</li>\n<li>E.g. The need to urinate even though the bladder has been removed. Menstrual cramps and labor pains after removing the uterus.</li>\n<li>If normal pain signals body damage, then phantom pain signals both body and pain system damage.</li>\n<li>Our pain maps get damaged and signal false alarms, making us believe the problem even though it’s long gone.</li>\n<li>After reading about Edward Taub’s plasticity experiments on monkeys, Ramachandran immediately thought that plasticity might explain phantom limbs because the brain maps for both monkeys and patients have been deprived of stimuli from their limbs.</li>\n<li>For Taub’s monkeys, stroking the impaired arm activated the face brain region. So, would stroking the monkey’s face feel like their face was being stroked or that their impaired arm was being stroked?</li>\n<li>In one of Ramachandran’s experiments on a phantom limb patient, T.S., stroking the patient’s cheek felt both like touching their face and touching their phantom limb.</li>\n<li>When Ramachandran put a drop of warm water on T.S.’s cheek, they felt a warm trickle move down their cheek and down their phantom limb.</li>\n<li>Using MEG, Ramachandran mapped T.S.’s arm and hand and found that their hand map was now being used to process facial sensations.</li>\n<li>In T.S., their hand and face maps had blurred together.</li>\n<li>Thus, neural plasticity and map invasion explains the phantom limb syndrome.</li>\n<li>Our skin has unique receptors to detect temperature, vibration, and pain. Sometimes after injury, the nerve fibers conveying touch information can be cross wired, resulting in feeling pressure as pain.</li>\n<li>Phantom maps, and all brain maps, are constantly changing borders and area.</li>\n<li>Phantom limbs can not only cause phantom pain, but also the feeling that the phantom limb is frozen, unable to move.</li>\n<li>This feeling of paralysis might be due to the lack of feedback the motor system receives from the amputated limb.</li>\n<li>To fix this, Ramachandran developed an ingenious method to generate phantom sensation.</li>\n<li>Using a mirror box, the patient can fool their own brain by placing their working limb on one side of the mirror and believing that the mirror image is the amputated limb.</li>\n<li>Similar to the rubber hand illusion, the brain plugs in the illusion, making it feel like the actual limb.</li>\n<li>One patient used the mirror box to remove his phantom limb and associated phantom pain.</li>\n<li>So, V. S. Ramachandran became the first physician to successfully amputate a phantom limb.</li>\n<li>The mirror box appears to cure pain by changing the patient’s perception of their body image.</li>\n<li>Pain and body image are closely related because we always experience pain as projected onto the body.</li>\n<li>We don’t need a physical body or even pain receptors to feel pain as we only need the body image produced by our brain maps.</li>\n<li>People with actual limbs don’t realize this because their body image is perfectly projected onto their physical body, making it impossible to distinguish between body image and physical body.</li>\n<li>However, phantom limbs enable us to make this distinction as physical body is gone while body image remains.</li>\n<li>Body image can be thought of as a copy or representation of the body in the brain. But if one copy changes without notifying the other, there’s a mismatch between copies leading to phantoms.</li>\n<li>Distorted body images are common and are further evidence that body image and physical body are separate.</li>\n<li>E.g.
