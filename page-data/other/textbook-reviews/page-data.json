This book is recommended for students competing in the Brain Bee competition and it’s decent. The level of detail is below an undergraduate textbook though and is biased towards the medical side of neuroscience. For instance, the book covers more disorders and abnormalities than usual. However, it’s a great introduction or review of the basics of the brain.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-cambridge-handbook-of-expertise-and-expert-performance\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-cambridge-handbook-of-expertise-and-expert-performance\" aria-label=\"the cambridge handbook of expertise and expert performance permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Cambridge Handbook of Expertise and Expert Performance</h3>\n<p><em>Rating: 3/5</em></p>\n<p>Your average literature-review-style textbook.

While the first part was ok and it introduced Marr’s three levels, the rest of the book feels dated and too technical. The heavy reliance on stereograms means that if you can’t see them (like me), you can’t do most of the examples. And stereograms aren’t representative of naturalistic stimuli so the arguments based on them are weaker. Another weakness was the lack of link to action/behavior and the lack of neurobiological detail. Sure, we can come up with technical theories of how vision works, but without verifying them against evidence, they’re just hypotheses. And that was the main feeling I got from this book: just a collection of outdated vision hypotheses. I wouldn’t recommend this textbook to learn anything about vision as our current understanding has vastly changed in the last 40 years. Instead, pick up “Principles of Neural Science” for the neuroscience of vision or “Principles of Neural Design” for the computatio behind vision.</p>\n<h3 id=\"networks-of-the-brain\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#networks-of-the-brain\" aria-label=\"networks of the brain permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Networks of the Brain</h3>\n<p><em>Rating: 3/5</em></p>\n<p>I’ve been wondering why the brain is described as a “small-world” network and this textbook explains what this phrase means (high clustering with short path lengths). Written by one of the important figures in network neuroscience, Olaf Sporn, it’s an ok textbook. The application of network science to the brain is fascinating and there’s potential for it to answer our questions about the brain. However, this textbook only has surface-level answers and the writing was dry. Like many other textbooks, this one was mostly a literature review with some good ideas thrown in here and there. The ideas are interesting but the presentation is lacking. Specifically, one of the biggest weaknesses  was the lack of connecting brain activity to behavior, as brain dynamics don’t mean anything in themselves.</p>\n<h3 id=\"principles-of-neural-science\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#principles-of-neural-science\" aria-label=\"principles of neural science permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Principles of Neural Science</h3>\n<p><em>Rating: 5/5</em></p>\n<p>The bible of neuroscience and a tome at over 1000 pages, this textbook is an encyclopedia of neuroscience knowledge. Both depth and breadth are covered but it was lacking in all areas such as the vision chapters that skipped over the LGN and color processing. The textbook also has no mention of any computational models such as the Hodgkin-Huxley equations of the action potential and has a biological bias towards genes and proteins. While this is expected, don’t expect this book to cover all of our knowledge on the brain as it’s missing a lot of psychology and computational viewpoints. But what it does cover, it does well as the writing and illustrations are excellent. Overall, this is a half-step from the introductory neuroscience textbooks. It doesn’t reach the level of papers or specialized textbooks, but it’s a good bridge from beginner to intermediate knowledge.</p>\n<h3 id=\"23-problems-in-systems-neuroscience\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#23-problems-in-systems-neuroscience\" aria-label=\"23 problems in systems neuroscience permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>23 Problems in Systems Neuroscience</h3>\n<p><em>Rating: 3/5</em></p>\n<p>Once again, a “see how many authors we can fit into a textbook” textbook but done ok-ish.

These topics are related to the brain but the approach is very far from neuroscience.

This is the issue with these types of textbooks, a collection of papers doesn’t make for a good story nor does it link separate ideas into a coherent theory or understanding.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cognitive-neuroscience-the-biology-of-the-mind\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#cognitive-neuroscience-the-biology-of-the-mind\" aria-label=\"cognitive neuroscience the biology of the mind permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Cognitive Neuroscience: The Biology of the Mind</h3>\n<p><em>Rating: 4/5</em></p>\n<p>The bible for cognitive neuroscience written by the field’s founder himself, this textbook is great for its level of detail and emphasis on cognition. However, I found a lot of the material to just be review of an introductory neuroscience textbook and it was sometimes just a regurgitation of the results from some uninteresting paper. If you skip the review parts like I did, then the textbook becomes more enjoyable as it delves into more details than an intro textbook, especially the experiments into cognition like split-brain patients.

I’ve been avoiding the philosophical side of neuroscience because I just find their ideas unjustified and neglecting the evidence we have of the brain. Like the mind-body problem shouldn’t be a problem and unconscious zombies have never been shown to exist. Avoiding that topic, this textbook didn’t really change my mind about the philosophy of the brain and mind. I did enjoy how the author mentioned neuroscience evidence such as the history behind the discovery of long-term potentiation, but I didn’t enjoy the writing. Philosophical writing comes off to me as pretentious and overly complicated for no good reason.

I really liked the clear exploration and reasoning behind each principle, but the writing was difficult to read throughout the book.

It’s very large at 1000 pages but the amount of detail covered is excellent. The approach to learning neuroanatomy through clinical cases is great because it links structure to function. So if you only want to learn about the structure of the nervous system, I would skip this textbook. There’s also a neurology spin to the knowledge since clinical cases are used which I found interesting and insightful. I’ve mostly been approaching neuroscience as a science but this textbook showed me that there’s also the application side of neuroscience, the medical side that actually helps people.

I liked how the author slowly built up the complexity of modeling from neurons to networks to systems. But I didn’t like the heavy emphasis on models and the lack of integration between the different levels of nervous system organization. Only now do I realize that computational neuroscience is a field of building more accurate, faster, efficient models, but I thought it would’ve emphasized the coding and computational properties of neurons more. An analogy would be like thinking computational physics as computing with physics (E.g. Quantum computers) but it’s actually modelling physics using a computer. I thought this textbook would focus on how neurons compute and how they connect to form pathways, circuits, networks, and systems, but this isn’t the case.

With this textbook, I could write an ML program and know fundamental ML principles. However, one drawback of this textbook is that it provides you the principles without showing you how they became principles. This is both good, because it avoids the heavy math behind DL, but also bad because then you lack the depth behind those principles. For a more details on the math behind DL, I recommend “Deep Learning” by Ian Goodfellow.

Overall, an ok AI history textbook, just skip the parts that don’t interest you.</p>\n<h3 id=\"neuroscience-exploring-the-brain\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#neuroscience-exploring-the-brain\" aria-label=\"neuroscience exploring the brain permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain</h3>\n<p><em>Rating: 5/5</em></p>\n<p>This was the first neuroscience textbook I read and it’s really good. There are three well known introductory neuroscience textbooks: this one, Neuroscience by Dale Purves, and From Neuron to Brain by John Nicholls. I’ve only read this one because it’s just that good; you don’t need to read any other one. I really enjoyed the writing style in that it’s a bit informal and fun. The only issue I had was that it lacked details in everything it mentioned. I mean, the textbook is already 1000 pages long (which is very long for a textbook) and it’s an introduction textbook, but the lack of detail made me search for the answers somewhere else. If you’re looking for the details or the next step, I recommend “Principles of Neural Science” by Eric Kandel, which is a graduate-level encyclopedia of neuroscience knowledge. Otherwise, this textbook is a great introduction to the science of the brain.</p>","tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#brain-facts\">Brain Facts</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#the-cambridge-handbook-of-expertise-and-expert-performance\">The Cambridge Handbook of Expertise and Expert Performance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#vision-science\">Vision Science</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#vision\">Vision</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#networks-of-the-brain\">Networks of the Brain</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#principles-of-neural-science\">Principles of Neural Science</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#23-problems-in-systems-neuroscience\">23 Problems in Systems Neuroscience</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#psychology-applied-to-modern-life\">Psychology Applied To Modern Life</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#brain-architecture-understanding-the-basic-plan\">Brain Architecture: Understanding the Basic Plan</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#an-introduction-to-information-theory-symbols-signals-and-noise\">An Introduction to Information Theory: Symbols, Signals and Noise</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#the-neurology-of-consciousness\">The Neurology of Consciousness</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#event-based-neuromorphic-systems-incomplete\">Event-Based Neuromorphic Systems (Incomplete)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#the-wiley-handbook-of-evolutionary-neuroscience\">The Wiley Handbook of Evolutionary Neuroscience</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#cognitive-neuroscience-the-biology-of-the-mind\">Cognitive Neuroscience: The Biology of the Mind</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#explaining-the-brain-mechanisms-and-the-mosaic-unity-of-neuroscience\">Explaining the Brain: Mechanisms and the Mosaic Unity of Neuroscience</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#principles-of-neural-design\">Principles of Neural Design</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#neuroanatomy-through-clinical-cases\">Neuroanatomy through Clinical Cases</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#fundamentals-of-computational-neuroscience\">Fundamentals of Computational Neuroscience</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#developmental-cognitive-neuroscience-an-introduction\">Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience: An Introduction</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#eloquent-javascript\">Eloquent JavaScript</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#how-to-build-a-brain-a-neural-architecture-for-biological-cognition\">How to Build a Brain: A Neural Architecture for Biological Cognition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#deep-learning-with-python\">Deep Learning with Python</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#after-digital-computation-as-done-by-brains-and-machines\">After Digital: Computation as Done by Brains and Machines</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#artificial-intelligence-a-modern-approach-incomplete\">Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (Incomplete)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#cognitive-science-an-introduction-to-the-science-of-the-mind\">Cognitive Science: An Introduction to the Science of the Mind</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#the-quest-for-artificial-intelligence\">The Quest for Artificial Intelligence</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#neuroscience-exploring-the-brain\">Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain</a></li>\n</ul>","timeToRead":12,"frontmatter":{"title":"Textbook Reviews","date":"July 21, 2021","book_authors":null,"categories":["Other"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/other/textbook-reviews/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/books/the-secret-of-our-success/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Secret of Our Success","layout":"post"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/other/book-reviews/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Book Reviews","layout":"post"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1031357278","1878747374","3666494887"],"slicesMap":{}}
