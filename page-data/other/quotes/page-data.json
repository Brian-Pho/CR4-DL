If someone doesn’t value logic, what logical argument could you provide to show the importance of logic?</li>\n<li>Not everything in science that is formally equivalent is semantically equivalent.</li>\n<li>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. - <strong>Carl Sagan</strong></li>\n<li>As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain, as far as they are certain they do not refer to reality. - <strong>Albert Einstein</strong></li>\n<li>The very lack of evidence is thus treated as evidence; the absence of smoke proves that the fire is very carefully hidden. - <strong>C. S. Lewis</strong></li>\n<li>Engineering will build the tools to test science, and science will invent the theories to guide the construction of tools.</li>\n<li>Explores formal principles of software engineering based on the common recognition that software engineering is not constrained by any physical laws as we know. - <strong>Yingxu Wang, ENSF 604</strong></li>\n<li>Interesting to think of physics as a set of compression algorithms for the universe. That’s basically what formulas are. - <strong>Elon Musk</strong></li>\n<li>You can prove anything you want by coldly logical reason, if you pick the proper postulates. - <strong>Isaac Asimov</strong></li>\n<li>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. - <strong>Arthur C. Clarke</strong></li>\n<li>The best way to predict the future is to invent it.</li>\n<li>The time dilation effect seems to have been made so that people are able to travel to the stars.</li>\n<li>Computer science actually began with its ‘theory of everything’.</li>\n<li>When you are famous it is hard to work on small problems. This is what did Shannon in. After information theory, what do you do for an encore? The great scientists often make this error. They fail to continue to plant the little acorns from which the mighty oak trees grow. They try to get the big thing right off. And that isn’t the way things go. So that is another reason why you find that when you get early recognition it seems to sterilize you. - <strong>Richard Hamming</strong></li>\n<li>What we know is a drop, what we don’t know is an ocean. - <strong>Issac Newton</strong></li>\n<li>You know how powerful science can be. A thousand years to climb from ghosts and magic to technology; a day and a half from technology back up to ghosts and magic. - <strong>Peter Watts, Firefall</strong></li>\n<li>Could we do this? Portia echoes the past question from Zaine and, to herself, admits that they could not. And yet we have come to them, not they to us. Always better to be the explorer than the explored. - <strong>Adrian Tchaikovsky, Children of Ruin</strong></li>\n<li>She understands, in a real and immediate way, how she stands on the backs of giants, and that her own back, too, will be strong enough to bear the weight of many generations to come. - <strong>Adrian Tchaikovsky, Children of Time</strong></li>\n<li>And part of the reason you are able to contribute so significantly to this project is that you are not burdened by unnecessary knowledge. Some of it might help you, I agree, but some of it would also narrow your options, steer your thoughts in one particular direction, prevent you from seeing all there is to see. Since I cannot know which information would hinder your thought processes, I find it best to provide you only with what you really need to know. - <strong>Sylvain Neuvel, Sleeping Giants</strong></li>\n<li>To steal ideas from one person is plagiarism. To steal from many is research. - <strong>Wilson Mizner</strong></li>\n<li>Even though most of us cannot separate science from superstition or technology from magic. - <strong>Peter Thiel</strong></li>\n<li>The drug of discovery.</li>\n<li>I strongly believe that the only way to encourage innovation is to give it to the young. The young have a great advantage in that they are ignorant. Because I think ignorance in science is very important. If you’re like me and you know too much you can’t try new things. I always work in fields of which I’m totally ignorant. - <strong>Sydney Brenner</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"neuroscience\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#neuroscience\" aria-label=\"neuroscience permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Neuroscience</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Praised be the human mind, which sees more sharply than does the human eye. - <strong>Aaron Bernstein</strong></li>\n<li>Intelligence attributes to itself as to why we are the dominant species of this planet.</li>\n<li>If our brains were simple enough for us to understand them, we’d be so simple that we couldn’t.</li>\n<li>We have not yet learned what the brain has to teach us. - <strong>Chris Eliasmith</strong></li>\n<li>Memory is the breaking and storing bits of passing time.</li>\n<li>It’s a poor sort of memory that only works backward.</li>\n<li>If there’s one thing I remember about memory, it’s that it doesn’t do its job.</li>\n<li>However, you owe these drugs back what they delivered to you.</li>\n<li>Being funny requires a considerable amount of intelligence.

It contains hundreds of billions of cells interlinked through trillions of connections. The brain boggles the mind. - <strong>James Watson</strong></li>\n<li>Change the eyes that look at the world, change the me does the looking? - <strong>Peter Watts, Firefall</strong></li>\n<li>[Direct stimulation of the visual cortex to induce hallucinations] That’s how you can tell it wasn’t. Since you don’t actually see it, there’s no messy eyeball optics to limit resolution. - <strong>Peter Watts, Firefall</strong></li>\n<li>Neurons only speak when spoken to; they don’t know why. - <strong>Peter Watts, Firefall</strong></li>\n<li>There is no red or green,” said Teller. “All the colors we see are artificial; they’re constructs of the mind. This beautiful rainbow of colors you see here on these felt-pens is, in reality, different shades of gray. - <strong>Peter Cawdron, Anomaly</strong></li>\n<li>There are birds that migrate by the stars, bats that echolocate, bees that compute the variance of flower patches, spiders that spin webs, humans that speak, ants that farm, lions that hunt in teams, cheetahs that hunt alone, monogamous gibbons, polyandrous seahorses, polygynous gorillas. There are millions of animal species on earth, each with a different set of cognitive programs. The same basic neural tissue embodies all of these programs, and it could support many others as well. Facts about the properties of neurons, neurotransmitters, and cellular development cannot tell you which of these millions of programs the human mind contains. Even if all neural activity is the expression of a uniform process at the cellular level, it is the arrangement of neurons—into bird song templates or web-spinning programs—that matters. - <strong>Steven Pinker, How the Mind Works</strong></li>\n<li>To explain how birds fly, we invoke principles of lift and drag and fluid mechanics that also explain how airplanes fly. That does not commit us to an Airplane Metaphor for birds, complete with jet engines and complimentary beverage service. - <strong>Steven Pinker, How the Mind Works</strong></li>\n<li>But then we always suspected the cortex is a mere blanket for regulating the temperature of the crucial parts of the brain. And while some continue to protest that “the folds of human cortex are what makes us unique!”, they are denying the simple, near universally-accepted explanation — greater surface area improves heat dissipation. - <strong>Mark Humphries, Review of 2019 in neuroscience</strong></li>\n<li>Cogito ergo sum (‘I think, therefore I am’) - <strong>Descartes</strong></li>\n<li>The brain is a world consisting of a number of unexplored continents and great stretches of unknown territory. - <strong>Santiago Ramon y Cajal</strong></li>\n<li>The initial cause of any human action lies outside the person. - <strong>Ivan Mikhailovich Sechenov</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"artificial-intelligence\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#artificial-intelligence\" aria-label=\"artificial intelligence permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Artificial Intelligence</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A year spent in artificial intelligence is enough to make one believe in God. - <strong>Alan Perlis</strong></li>\n<li>Artificial intelligence is basically willy nilly, stabbing in the dark, trying to model natural intelligence.</li>\n<li>Artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity.</li>\n<li>Just like how there’s a certain combination of DNA (ATCG) that made us, there must be a certain combination of 0s and 1s that make AI.</li>\n<li>Solve intelligence and then use it to help society solve everything else.</li>\n<li>The field was founded on the claim that human intelligence “can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.”</li>\n<li>Any A.I. smart enough to pass a Turing test is smart enough to know to fail it.</li>\n<li>The robots declared us “artificially intelligent”.</li>\n<li>To erase the line between man and machine is to obscure the line between men and gods. - <strong>Ex Machina</strong></li>\n<li>To build a machine smarter than you, it has to be more complex than you—and the ability to understand the machine begins to slip away. - <strong>David Eagleman, Sum</strong></li>\n<li>An electronic computer is also made up of matter, but organized differently; what is there so magical about the workings of the huge, slow cells of the animal brain that they can claim themselves to be conscious, but would deny a quicker, more finely-grained device of equivalent power - or even a machine hobbled so that it worked with precisely the same ponderous-ness - a similar distinction? - <strong>Iain M. Banks, Use of Weapons</strong></li>\n<li>They [superintelligent AI] are rarely malicious, never vicious; not to us. Mainly this is because we are so far beneath them it would be demeaning to get that worked up about us and our feelings, but the thing is, they are vastly powerful artefacts, with senses and abilities and strengths that we only fool ourselves we know about or understand, and the subtlest, most infinitesimal of their machinations can bruise us, crush us utterly, if it catches us wrong. - <strong>Iain M. Banks, The Hydrogen Sonata</strong></li>\n<li>But in all cases communication is about projecting information. Man is the only animal that uses an intermediary form for communication, something static that forms a kind of intellectual echo, whether that’s a book or text on a computer screen, art hanging in a gallery or a play shown on the television, the principle is the same. The act of capturing communication, storing it and reusing it is a hallmark of intelligence, and I think they’ll appreciate that. - <strong>Peter Cawdron, Anomaly</strong></li>\n<li>Senkovi’s personal theory was that the pressure of being in the middle of the food chain was an essential prerequisite for complex intelligence. Like humans (and like Portiid spiders, had he only known), octopuses had developed in a world where they were both hunter and hunted. Top predators, in Senkovi’s assessment, were an intellectual dead end. - <strong>Adrian Tchaikovsky, Children of Ruin</strong></li>\n<li>I wonder, briefly, if I’m going to have to go in there. And it occurs to me that until someone licks AI, this is why NASA needs monkeys in space. To make stupid monkey decisions like these. - <strong>Hugh Howey, Beacon 23</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"dreams\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#dreams\" aria-label=\"dreams permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Dreams</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We’re still pioneers, we’ve barely begun.
